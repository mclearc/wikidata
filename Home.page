# Welcome

My name is [Colin McLear](http://colinmclear.net). I'm an assistant professor
in the [philosophy department](http://unl.edu/philosophy/philosophy) at the
[University of Nebraska--Lincoln](http://unl.edu). Welcome to my research wiki.
Here I collect notes on work in progress and archival materials.

Help is always available through the "Help" link in the sidebar.
More details on installing and configurating gitit are available
