# Rationalist Philosophy of Mathematics #

A dominant research program amongst philosophers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries accounted for mathematical knowledge in terms of the
possession and analysis of concepts. Kant's view is largely articulated in
opposition to this broadly rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge.
One of the most influential philosophers in Germany prior to Kant, [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754),
articulated a theory of mathematical knowledge in which all mathematical
(including geometrical) knowledge could be demonstrated in terms of explicit,
step-by-step inferences from the contents of our mathematical concepts,
which could be reconstructed in classical syllogistic form.

# Kant against Logicism #

## Mathematics as Synthetic ##


## Mathematics as A Priori ##


# Philosophy and Mathematics #

Kant is deeply critical of the prevailing view in Germany that philosophy and
mathematics share similar aims and methods, and that philosophical questions
may be pursued with the same tools that the mathematician uses in the course of
giving mathematical proofs. This was true both of philosophers outside of
Germany, such as Descartes and Spinoza, and philosophers inside Germany, such
as Leibniz and Wolff. [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754) is
perhaps the figure Kant most clearly has in mind in his criticisms of
philosophical practice modeled on mathematics.
