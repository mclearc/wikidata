**JL §106 9:143-4**

> By mere _definitions of names,__ _or _nominal definitions,_ are to be
> understood those that contain the meaning that one wanted arbitrarily to give
> to a certain name, and which therefore signify only the logical essence of
> their object, or which serve merely for distinguishing it from other objects.
> _Definitions of things,__ _or _real definitions,_ on the other hand, are ones
> that suffice for cognition of the object according to its inner
> determinations, since they present the possibility of the object from inner
> marks.
>  
>   * _Note 1__._ [144] If a concept is internally sufficient for
>     distinguishing the thing then it certainly is externally sufficient too,
>     but if it is not internally sufficient then it can be externally
>     sufficient merely in _a_ _certain relation,_ namely, in the comparison of
>     the _definitum_ with other things. But _unrestricted_ external
>     sufficiency is not possible without internal sufficiency.

>   * _2._ Objects of experience allow only nominal explanations. Logical
>     nominal definitions of given concepts of the understanding are derived
>     from an attribute, real definitions, on the other hand, from the essence
>     of the thing, the first ground of possibility. Thus the latter contain
>     what always belongs to the thing – its real essence. Merely _negative_
>     definitions cannot be called real definitions either, because negative
>     marks can serve just as well as affirmative ones for distinguishing one
>     thing from others, but not for cognition of the thing according to its
>     inner possibility. In matters of morals real definitions must always be
>     sought; all our striving must be directed toward this. There are real
>     definitions in mathematics, for the definition of an arbitrary concept is
>     always _real._
>   * _3._ A definition is _genetic_ if it yields a concept through which the
>     object can be exhibited *a priori in concreto*; all mathematical
>     definitions are of this sort.
