# An A Priori Deduction? #

Friedman argues that

>the aim of Kant's special metaphysics of corporeal nature is not to deduce a
priori the quantitative structure of the (Newtonian) mathematical theory of
motion from either metaphysics or pure mathematics. He aims, rather, to use all
the resources of his revolutionary metaphysics of experience to explain, step
by step, how the fundamental *empirical* concepts of this theory acquire their
quantitative (measurable) structure and thereby become amenable to a
mathematical (rather than merely metaphysical) a priori treatment.[^14506]

Certainly Friedman is right that it is not Kant's aim to give an a
priori deduction of all the features of any particular body of matter,
or possibly even all the features of matter generally, whatever its
particular configurations. But with regard to `<matter>` it does seem
that Kant aims to give an a priori deduction of why it has at least some
of the features that it does, in order to be able to claim that *matter*
has some set of necessary features, and that its other features flow
from these.
