title: Mathematics & Objective Validity
categories: Kant, Mathematics, Intuition, Definition
...

A variety of people have denied that the objective validity of
mathematical concepts may be demonstrated a priori.[^173125] I think
these positions must be mistaken, but it is useful to see how and why.

Manley Thompson ([thompson1972]())
[argues](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/thompson1972.pdf?page=26)
that mathematics and mathematical proof, including geometrical
construction, is not concerned with existence, but rather something like
'mere' constructibility.

>While mathematical constructions, whether ostensive or symbolic, provide
>objects for mathematical concepts and thus answer existence questions *within*
>mathematics, they do not answer existence questions absolutely. What appear
>as existence questions in mathematics are really questions of constructibility
>and not existence.[^17439]

[^17439]: @thompson1972, 338. 

Thompson makes this point primarily on the basis of the following text
from the Discipline section of CPR.

>There is, to be sure, a transcendental synthesis from concepts alone, with
>which in turn only the philosopher can succeed, but which never concerns more
>than a thing in general, with regard to the conditions under which its
>perception could belong to possible experience. But in mathematical problems
>the question is not about this nor about existence as such at all, but about
>the properties of the objects in themselves, solely insofar as these are
>combined with the concept of them. (A719/B747)

Thompson thus concludes that *existence* (actuality or *wirklichkeit*)
can only be given in perception (empirical intuition) and thus can't be
the subject matter of mathematical construction in a priori pure intuition.
Now, this point, so far as it goes seems correct. Kant makes a similar
point in the initial footnote in the Preface to the MFNS where he says,

>Essence is the first inner principle of everything that belongs to the
possibility of a thing. Therefore one can only speak of the essence of
geometric figures (in whose concept nothing may be thought that expresses
existence [*Dasein*]), not of their nature. (4:468)

But Thompson goes on to cite a passage from the B- deduction that makes a
stronger claim---viz. that mathematical knowledge (or cognition) depends on the
actual existence and application of the a priori forms of intuition in objects
of experience. The full quote is as follows.

>Through determination of the former we can acquire *a priori* cognitions of
>objects (in mathematics), but only as far as their form is concerned, as
>appearances; whether there can be things that must be intuited in this form is
>still left unsettled. Consequently all mathematical concepts are not by
>themselves cognitions, except insofar as one presupposes that there are things
>that can be presented to us only in accordance with the form of that pure
>sensible intuition. **Things in space** and **time**, however, are only given
>insofar as they are perceptions (representations accompanied with sensation),
>hence through empirical representation. The pure concepts of the
>understanding, consequently, even if they are applied to *a priori* intuitions
>(as in mathematics), provide cognition only insofar as these *a priori*
>intuitions, and by means of them also the concepts of the understanding, can
>be applied to empirical intuitions. (§22, B147)

The key sentence here is, I think, the last. Kant lays down a condition
on the status of the a priori concepts and intuitions as cognitions only
if the '**can be applied to empirical intuitions**'. So Kant isn't
claiming that we lack mathematical knowledge unless we have empirical
intuitions of existing object to which we apply mathematical concepts.
Indeed, it is completely compatible with the above text that no
empirical objects exist. All that seems necessary for mathematical
representation to attain the status of cognition is that the concepts
involved (and their correlate constructions in pure intuitions) *could
apply*.

, Kant seems to
clearly say so in a variety of places. 

>Herr Eberhard wants to free himself from the demand, so trouble- some to all
>dogmatists yet so unavoidable, that no concept be admitted to the rank of
>cognitions if its objective reality is not made evident by the possibility of
>the object's being exhibited in a corresponding intuition. He thus calls upon
>the mathematicians, who are supposed not to have said a single word about the
>reality of the objects of their concepts, and who nevertheless have succeeded
>in designing entire sciences. He could hardly have hit upon a more unfortunate
>example for his purpose. For the situation is exactly the opposite: the
>mathematician cannot make the smallest assertion about any object whatsoever
>without exhibiting it in intuition (or, if we are considering only quantities
>without qualities, as in algebra, exhibiting the quantitative relationships
>for which the symbols stand). (Letter to Karl Leonard Reinhold. May 19, 1789;
11:41)

>Mathematics is the most excellent model for all synthetic use of reason, just
>because the intuitions _with which_ mathematics confers objective reality upon
>its concepts are never lacking. In philosophy, however, and indeed, in
>theoretical knowledge, this demand for intuitions is one with which we cannot
>always sufficiently comply. When intuitions are lacking, we must be resigned
>to forgo the claim that our concepts have the status of cognitions of objects.
