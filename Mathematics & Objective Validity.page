title: Mathematics & Objective Validity

A variety of people have denied that the objective validity of
mathematical concepts may be demonstrated a priori.[^173125] I think
these positions must be mistaken, but it is useful to see how and why.

# Thompson #

Manley Thompson ([thompson1972]())
[argues](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/thompson1972.pdf?page=26)
that mathematics and mathematical proof, including geometrical
construction, is not concerned with existence, but rather something like
'mere' constructibility.

>While mathematical constructions, whether ostensive or symbolic, provide
>objects for mathematical concepts and thus answer existence questions *within*
>mathematics, they do not answer existence questions absolutely. What appear
>as existence questions in mathematics are really questions of constructibility
>and not existence.[^17439]

[^17439]: @thompson1972, 338. 

Thompson makes this point primarily on the basis of the following text
from the Discipline section of CPR.

>There is, to be sure, a transcendental synthesis from concepts alone, with
>which in turn only the philosopher can succeed, but which never concerns more
>than a thing in general, with regard to the conditions under which its
>perception could belong to possible experience. But in mathematical problems
>the question is not about this nor about existence as such at all, but about
>the properties of the objects in themselves, solely insofar as these are
>combined with the concept of them. (A719/B747)

Thompson thus concludes that *existence* (or better, actuality or
*wirklichkeit*) can only be given in perception (empirical intuition) and thus
can't be the subject matter of mathematical construction in a priori pure
intuition. Now, this point, so far as it goes seems correct. Kant makes a
similar point in the initial footnote in the Preface to the MFNS where he says,

>Essence is the first inner principle of everything that belongs to the
possibility of a thing. Therefore one can only speak of the essence of
geometric figures (in whose concept nothing may be thought that expresses
existence [*Dasein*]), not of their nature. (4:468)

But Thompson goes on to cite a passage from the B- deduction that makes a
stronger claim---viz. that mathematical knowledge (or cognition) depends on the
actual existence and application of the a priori forms of intuition in objects
of experience. The full quote is as follows.

>Through determination of the former we can acquire *a priori* cognitions of
>objects (in mathematics), but only as far as their form is concerned, as
>appearances; whether there can be things that must be intuited in this form is
>still left unsettled. Consequently all mathematical concepts are not by
>themselves cognitions, except insofar as one presupposes that there are things
>that can be presented to us only in accordance with the form of that pure
>sensible intuition. **Things in space** and **time**, however, are only given
>insofar as they are perceptions (representations accompanied with sensation),
>hence through empirical representation. The pure concepts of the
>understanding, consequently, even if they are applied to *a priori* intuitions
>(as in mathematics), provide cognition only insofar as these *a priori*
>intuitions, and by means of them also the concepts of the understanding, can
>be applied to empirical intuitions. (§22, B147)

The key sentence here is, I think, the last. Kant lays down a condition
on the status of the a priori concepts and intuitions as cognitions only
if they '**can be applied to empirical intuitions**'. So Kant isn't
claiming that we lack mathematical knowledge unless we have empirical
intuitions of existing objects to which we apply mathematical concepts.
Indeed, it is completely compatible with the above text that no
empirical objects exist. All that seems necessary for mathematical
representation to attain the status of cognition is that the concepts
involved (and their correlate constructions in pure intuitions) *could
apply*. 



# Brittan #

# Parsons #

Parsons, in his [parsons1983a]() postscript to [parsons1969](),
discusses the compatibility of his preferred interpretation with
Thompson's point that Kant is not concerned with the *existence* of
mathematical objects. Parsons, like Hintikka, assumes that intuitions,
as singular representations, denote objects. Central parts of his
discussion in §§V-VI of parsons1969 concern the existence of
mathematical objects, so he takes Thompson's point as requiring some
real modification of his own view. Parsons says of his view,

>A picture common to us [viz. him and Hintikka] is of pure intuitions as
analogous to *free variables*, with predicates attached to them representing
the concepts they 'construct.' If we are not to import into Kant the
'mathematical-objects picture,' then it seems we have to take the *range* of
these variables to be *empirical* objects. Then a mathematical argument cannot,
strictly speaking, establish existence. What plays the role of
mathematical existence in Kant is constructibility. THe most plausible
reconstruction of Kant would be, in my view, to take constructibility of
a concept to be a kind of possible existence of a (nonabstract) object
falling under the concept.[^111252]

[^111252]: @parsons1983a, 148.

Parsons then notes that the real difficulty is not with existence but
possibility---viz. *real* possibility. Parsons then seems to deny (here
I'm not entirely sure, his discussion is brief and unclear) that
construction in pure intuition, *by itself*, is sufficient for proof of
real possibility. His thought seems to be that more is needed from *
experience*.

>What makes the construction itself fall short of showing possibility is that
possibility involves agreement with the formal conditions of experience with
respect to intuition *and concepts*, that is, not only the forms of intuition
but the categories. Thus in order to see the possibility of a triangle, we have
to observe that space is a formal condition of outer experience and that 'the
formative synthesis through which we construct a triangle in imagination is
precisely the same as that which we exercise in the apprehension of an
appearance, in making for ourselves an empirical concept of it' (A224/B271).
This, of course, repeats the considerations advanced in the Axioms of
Intuition. THe ' objective reality' in the full sense of mathematical concepts
seems to be a proposition not of mathematics but of philosophy.[^111952]

[^111952]: @parsons1983a, 149.

I find this last sentence a bit perplexing. Does this mean the mathematician
must rely on the philosopher to provide him with mathematical knowledge? That
seems both wrong and in tension with Kant's position in the Discipline
concerning the differences between mathematics and philosophy. One of Kant's
central points there is that the mathematician *doesn't* need to wait around
for an analysis of concepts but proceeds directly from the construction of the
concept to providing it with an object in pure intuition.

In appealing to the Axioms of Intuition I see some similarity between the
position expressed by Parsons and Carson's position in [carson1997](). I had
originally thought that a good middle way, but not I'm not so sure . Especially
if it has the consequences that I take Parsons's expression of the view to
have.

# Friedman #

Friedman ([friedman1992]()) articulates what he takes to be a prima
facie attractive interpretation of Kant's philosophy of mathematics (99-
100). This interpretation consists in thinking that the objective
validity of mathematical concepts depends on their objects being really
possible or objectively real. This is not possible with concepts alone,
for all that is had is logical consistency demonstrating their logical
possibility. Something is needed to show that, of the set of logically
possible mathematical concepts, some subset has objective meaning --- is
objectively real or really possible. This is what a priori intuition is
supposed to provide.

Friedman objects to this interpretation along several lines. First, he
argues that 'Kant himself does not employ pure intuition to provide
objects and objective reality for the concepts of mathematics, or indeed
for any concepts'.[^115128] Proof of objective reality depends entirely
on *empirical* intuition.[^115237] Friedman thus seems to agree with
Parsons that,

[^115237]: For further discussion of this argument see my discussion of
Friedman's views on the [construction of `<matter>`](The Construction of Matter#friedman-construction).

[^115128]: @friedman1992, 101. [PDF](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/friedman1992.pdf?page=109).

>pure intuition, at least by itself, can in no way demonstrate or exhibit the
real possibility of mathematics. For Kant, such real possibility means that
mathematics is applicable to empirical objects (objects of experience), and
this cannot be shown except on the basis of transcendental philosophy itself:
officially, at A165-166/B206-207.[^11579]

[^11579]: @friedman1992, 101.

This must be mistaken. Perhaps what is needed is some intermediate
conception of real possibility. It seems that the real possibility of
mathematical objects *is* presented in pure intuition, and thus that
this possibility, though stronger than logical possibility, is different
from the possibility of an actually *existing* empirical object. More on
this issue below.

Friedman's second objection is that it is altogether unclear how pure
intuition could perform the kind of selection task that the prima facie
attractive interpretation would suggest.

>The underlying idea is that the real possibilities are a subclass of the much
>wider class of logical possibilities: there are logically possible states of
>affairs that are nonetheless not really possible. Pure intuition then selects
>a narrower range of possibilities from the logical possibilities-it declares
>that certain logically possible states of affairs are not really possible-and
>thus generates the synthetic truths of mathematics. But how, on the present
>conception, is pure intuition supposed to perform this selection; and how are
>we supposed to have cognitive access to it?[^123951]

[^123951]: @friedman1992, 102.

Friedman takes the example of Euclidean and Non-Euclidean geometries. 

>it is supposed to be logically possible that any particular triangle I
construct or encounter should be Euclidean or non-Euclidean: the sum of its
angles could (logically) be equal to 180˚ or could (logically) be equal to 180˚
± .0000010˚, say. How is pure intuition  possibly able to distinguish these two
cases?[^124819]

[^124819]: @friedman1992, 103.

Friedman thinks the problem is quite general and cites several other sources
agreeing with him.[^124940] The basic assumption here, which does not seem
obvious to me, is that there will be a phenomenal difference between the
Euclidean and non-Euclidean intuition, and that this phenomenal difference
would need to be discriminable by us if intuition were to ground one geometry
over the other. But it isn't obvious to me that Kant makes either of these
assumptions. First, it isn't clear that the grounding relation pure intuition
plays in geometry is (entirely) phenomenal, and second, it isn't clear that
even if it is a phenomenal basis, the grounding relation only has epistemic
significance via our capacity to successfully discriminate phenomenal
differences across cases. Maybe it just depends on our being able to have the
requisite intuition, regardless of whether we can (or can always) discriminate
between close cases.

[^124940]: This question is raised by Parsons in "Infinity and Kant's Conception of the 'Possibility of Experience'" (1964), reprinted in
@parsons1983; it is also discussed in [\@kitcher1975](kitcher1975), §5.

# Carson #

Carson (@carson1997, 508) agrees with Friedman (cf. [friedman1992]()) that
construction in pure intuition does not prove the real possibililty of the
related mathematical concept. Accordingly, it must be empirical intuition that
provides the requisite proof.[^113850]

[^113850]: @carson1997, 506.

Carson attempts to develop a [middle ground](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/carson1997.pdf?page=21)
according to which construction does not, by itself establish the real
possiblility of its object, but rather only in virtue of the proof in
the Axioms of Intuition. 

>Thus mathematical concepts earn their objective reality derivatively: in
establishing that whatever geometry asserts of pure intuition is valid of
empirical intuition, the objective reality of geometrical concepts which are
constructible in pure intuition is thereby also established. As Kant says at
A733/B761: 'the possibility of mathematics must itself be demonstrated in
transcendental philosophy.' In other words, once the transcendental facts are
given, and the objective validity of pure intuition is established, we can see
that construction in pure intuition in turn confers objective reality on
mathematical concepts. It is irrelevant whether or not the mathematician alone
provides the complete demonstration. Indeed, there is thus a clear distinction
between constructibility and existence: mathematicians are not concerned with
real existence at all, the way philosophers are.[^11435]

[^11435]: @carson1997, 508.

This seems very similar to [Parson's position](#parsons) above. If so,
it goes too far. The dependence relation of mathematics on philosophy is
only one concerning the *explanation* of how mathematical knowledge is
possible, not the *existence* of the mathematical knowledge itself. But Carson suggests something closer to my preferred view when she says
that,

>we can obtain knowledge of geometrical propositions – hence objectively valid
>true judgments – without requiring any experience. The condition for the
>objective reality of the concepts involved in these judgments therefore cannot
>be that their objects be presented in empirical intuition; it is rather that
>space is the condition of the appearances which constitute the material for
>outer experience. That is, the condition for the objective reality of
>constructible mathematical concepts is the objective validity of the concept
>of space.[^145611]

[^145611]: @carson1997, 509.

So it is in this sense that the synthetic judgment of mathematics relate 'only
mediately to possible experience, or rather, to the possibility of experience;
and upon that alone is founded the objective validity of their synthesis'
(A157/B191). This much seems right. But Carson still makes too much of
this point by saying that,

>We can therefore conclude that construction in pure intuition, *given* the
>results of transcendental philosophy, establishes the real possibility of
>(empirical) objects corresponding to the concepts.[^1529]

[^1529]: @carson1997, 509.

Construction in pure intuition, independent of the results of transcendental
philosophy, establishes the real possibility of its objects. But the
explanation of how this is possible, or more precisely, of how it is possible
that knowledge results from this, is given by Kant's critical philosophy
---specifically, the Deduction and the Axioms of Intuition.

# Kant on the Objective Reality of Mathematics #

Kant seems to clearly say, in a variety of places, that construction in
pure intuition is sufficient to demonstrate both the real possibility
and the objective reality of mathematical concepts.

>Herr Eberhard wants to free himself from the demand, so troublesome to all
>dogmatists yet so unavoidable, that no concept be admitted to the rank of
>cognitions if its objective reality is not made evident by the possibility of

>in designing entire sciences. He could hardly have hit upon a more unfortunate
>example for his purpose. For the situation is exactly the opposite: the
>mathematician cannot make the smallest assertion about any object whatsoever
>without exhibiting it in intuition (or, if we are considering only quantities

>for which the symbols stand). (Letter to Karl Leonard Reinhold. May 19, 1789;
11:41)

>Mathematics is the most excellent model for all synthetic use of reason, just
>because the intuitions _with which_ mathematics confers objective reality upon

>(Letter to Karl Leonard Reinhold. May 19, 1789; 11:43)

The explanation of how mathematical knowledge is possible is only given
by transcendental philosophy, there is nothing within mathematics itself
to answer this question. But this does not mean that mathematics is not
itself a science, or that knowledge in mathematics depends on knowledge
within transcendental philosophy. The exhibition of a mathematical
concept's object *in concreto* in pure intuition is sufficient for
demonstration of the real possibility of the object and the objective
validity of the concept. The mathematician need not advert to philosophy
in order to possess this knowledge. 

The dependence relation comes in only at the point of explaining how
this knowledge is possible. Such an explanation depends on the fact that
the a priori concepts of quantity and magnitude are not 'mere play', and
thus have a connection to empirical objects. This in turn depends on the
kind of arguments given by Kant in the Deduction and in the Axioms of
Intuition. But it seems to me that Thompson, Brittan, Friedman, Parsons,
and even Carson all go too far in asserting a dependence relation
between the objective validity of mathematical concepts and empirical
intuition.
