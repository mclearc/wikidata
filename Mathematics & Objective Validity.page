title: Mathematics & Objective Validity
categories: Kant, Mathematics, Intuition, Definition
...

A variety of people have denied that the objective validity of
mathematical concepts may be demonstrated a priori.[^173125] I think
these positions must be mistaken, but it is useful to see how and why.

# Thompson #

Manley Thompson ([thompson1972]())
[argues](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/thompson1972.pdf?page=26)
that mathematics and mathematical proof, including geometrical
construction, is not concerned with existence, but rather something like
'mere' constructibility.

>While mathematical constructions, whether ostensive or symbolic, provide
>objects for mathematical concepts and thus answer existence questions *within*
>mathematics, they do not answer existence questions absolutely. What appear
>as existence questions in mathematics are really questions of constructibility
>and not existence.[^17439]

[^17439]: @thompson1972, 338. 

Thompson makes this point primarily on the basis of the following text
from the Discipline section of CPR.

>There is, to be sure, a transcendental synthesis from concepts alone, with
>which in turn only the philosopher can succeed, but which never concerns more
>than a thing in general, with regard to the conditions under which its
>perception could belong to possible experience. But in mathematical problems
>the question is not about this nor about existence as such at all, but about
>the properties of the objects in themselves, solely insofar as these are
>combined with the concept of them. (A719/B747)

Thompson thus concludes that *existence* (or better, actuality or
*wirklichkeit*) can only be given in perception (empirical intuition) and thus
can't be the subject matter of mathematical construction in a priori pure
intuition. Now, this point, so far as it goes seems correct. Kant makes a
similar point in the initial footnote in the Preface to the MFNS where he says,

>Essence is the first inner principle of everything that belongs to the
possibility of a thing. Therefore one can only speak of the essence of
geometric figures (in whose concept nothing may be thought that expresses
existence [*Dasein*]), not of their nature. (4:468)

But Thompson goes on to cite a passage from the B- deduction that makes a
stronger claim---viz. that mathematical knowledge (or cognition) depends on the
actual existence and application of the a priori forms of intuition in objects
of experience. The full quote is as follows.

>Through determination of the former we can acquire *a priori* cognitions of
>objects (in mathematics), but only as far as their form is concerned, as
>appearances; whether there can be things that must be intuited in this form is
>still left unsettled. Consequently all mathematical concepts are not by
>themselves cognitions, except insofar as one presupposes that there are things
>that can be presented to us only in accordance with the form of that pure
>sensible intuition. **Things in space** and **time**, however, are only given
>insofar as they are perceptions (representations accompanied with sensation),
>hence through empirical representation. The pure concepts of the
>understanding, consequently, even if they are applied to *a priori* intuitions
>(as in mathematics), provide cognition only insofar as these *a priori*
>intuitions, and by means of them also the concepts of the understanding, can
>be applied to empirical intuitions. (§22, B147)

The key sentence here is, I think, the last. Kant lays down a condition
on the status of the a priori concepts and intuitions as cognitions only
if they '**can be applied to empirical intuitions**'. So Kant isn't
claiming that we lack mathematical knowledge unless we have empirical
intuitions of existing objects to which we apply mathematical concepts.
Indeed, it is completely compatible with the above text that no
empirical objects exist. All that seems necessary for mathematical
representation to attain the status of cognition is that the concepts
involved (and their correlate constructions in pure intuitions) *could
apply*. 



# Brittan #

# Parsons #

Parsons, in his [parsons1983a]() postscript to [parsons1969](),
discusses the compatibility of his preferred interpretation with
Thompson's point that Kant is not concerned with the *existence* of
mathematical objects. Parsons, like Hintikka, assumes that intuitions,
as singular representations, denote objects. Central parts of his
discussion in §§V-VI of parsons1969 concern the existence of
mathematical objects, so he takes Thompson's point as requiring some
real modification of his own view. Parsons says of his view,

>A picture common to us [viz. him and Hintikka] is of pure intuitions as
analogous to *free variables*, with predicates attached to them representing
the concepts they 'construct.' If we are not to import into Kant the
'mathematical-objects picture,' then it seems we have to take the *range* of
these variables to be *empirical* objects. Then a mathematical argument cannot,
strictly speaking, establish existence. What plays the role of
mathematical existence in Kant is constructibility. THe most plausible
reconstruction of Kant would be, in my view, to take constructibility of
a concept to be a kind of possible existence of a (nonabstract) object
falling under the concept.[^111252]

[^111252]: @parsons1983a, 148.

Parsons then notes that the real difficulty is not with existence but
possibility---viz. *real* possibility. Parsons then seems to deny (here
I'm not entirely sure, his discussion is brief and unclear) that
construction in pure intuition, *by itself*, is sufficient for proof of
real possibility. His thought seems to be that more is needed from *
experience*.

>What makes the construction itself fall short of showing possibility is that
possibility involves agreement with the formal conditions of experience with
respect to intuition *and concepts*, that is, not only the forms of intuition
but the categories. Thus in order to see the possibility of a triangle, we have
to observe that space is a formal condition of outer experience and that 'the
formative synthesis through which we construct a triangle in imagination is
precisely the same as that which we exercise in the apprehension of an
appearance, in making for ourselves an empirical concept of it' (A224/B271).
This, of course, repeats the considerations advanced in the Axioms of
Intuition. THe ' objective reality' in the full sense of mathematical concepts
seems to be a proposition not of mathematics but of philosophy.[^111952]

[^111952]: @parsons1983a, 149.

I find this last sentence a bit perplexing. Does this mean the mathematician
must rely on the philosopher to provide him with mathematical knowledge? That
seems both wrong and in tension with Kant's position in the Discipline
concerning the differences between mathematics and philosophy. One of Kant's
central points there is that the mathematician *doesn't* need to wait around
for an analysis of concepts but proceeds directly from the construction of the
concept to providing it with an object in pure intuition.

In appealing to the Axioms of Intuition I see some similarity between the
position expressed by Parsons and Carson's position in [carson1997](). I had
originally thought that a good middle way, but not I'm not so sure . Especially
if it has the consequences that I take Parsons's expression of the view to
have.

, Kant seems to
clearly say so in a variety of places. 

>Herr Eberhard wants to free himself from the demand, so trouble- some to all
>dogmatists yet so unavoidable, that no concept be admitted to the rank of
>cognitions if its objective reality is not made evident by the possibility of
>the object's being exhibited in a corresponding intuition. He thus calls upon
>the mathematicians, who are supposed not to have said a single word about the
>reality of the objects of their concepts, and who nevertheless have succeeded
>in designing entire sciences. He could hardly have hit upon a more unfortunate
>example for his purpose. For the situation is exactly the opposite: the
>mathematician cannot make the smallest assertion about any object whatsoever
>without exhibiting it in intuition (or, if we are considering only quantities
>without qualities, as in algebra, exhibiting the quantitative relationships
>for which the symbols stand). (Letter to Karl Leonard Reinhold. May 19, 1789;
11:41)

>Mathematics is the most excellent model for all synthetic use of reason, just
>because the intuitions _with which_ mathematics confers objective reality upon

>always sufficiently comply. When intuitions are lacking, we must be resigned
>to forgo the claim that our concepts have the status of cognitions of objects.
