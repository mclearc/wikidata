# Euclid on Definition 

**Introduction, ch.9, ยง7** [PDF](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/euclid1908.pdf?page=152)

Euclid characterizes definition in Aristotelian terms. Definition does
not concern the *existence* of a thing, but rather its *possibility*.
Heath characterizes things this way,

>It is an answer to the question *what* a thing is, and does not say *that* it
is. The *existence* of the various things defined has to be proved, except in
the case of a few primary things in each science, the existence of which is
indemonstrable and must be assumed among the first principles of each science ;
e.g. points and lines in geometry must be *assumed* to exist, but the existence
of everything else must be proved.[^135248]

[^135248]: @euclid1908, 143.

Here's Euclid's definition of a circle (definition 15):

>A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight
>lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure are
>equal to one another.[^13573]

[^13573]: @euclid1908, 153. Definition 16 labels this point the '*centre*'.

As Heath points out, the definition is not *genetic*, it does prove the
existence of its figure or provide the means of constructing it. This is
done only in the Third Postulate.

>To describe a circle with any centre and distance.[^14832]

[^14832]: @euclid1908, 154. The original Greek has the passive of the verb
, so it literally reads, "a circle can be drawn with any centre and
distance". Proclus modifies the Greek so that it has the active form of
the verb in order to match the first two postulates.
