The discussion of space as God's sensorium is useful in that it points to the kind of parallell I wish to draw regarding intuition in humans and in God --- viz. that their structure is monistic in both. The discussion of space in Newton and in Kant would thus be a connecting rather than fundamentally explantory factor.

## Overview ##  


**Overview: :** Helpful discussion of the historical progress of Kant's thinking concerning the (broadly) Newtonian position that space is God's '*sensorium*'. Insole argues that Kant's view regarding the status of space as ideal was motivated, at least in part, by consideration of Newton's (and Clarke's Newton) view that space was the manifestation of God's omnipresence. Insole rightly points out how problematic Kant took this claim. I'm less confident that there is a traceable causal path here from Newton's idea to Kant's, but Insole assembles some interesting texts from the notes and lectures.  ([p.414][265w])

## Summary Text ##  


"By tilting the vocabulary in a Kantian direction, we could say that space, for Newton, is not a thing in itself, or a property of things-in-themselves, but the ‘‘form of divine intuition,’’ the means by which reality is present to God. The strangeness of importing Kantian terms would only be a problem if I were making the not very promising claim that Kant had influenced Newton, or even that Newton was anticipating Kant: rather, the claim is that Newton, on a plausible interpretation of published work available to Kant (an interpretation supported by some of his unpublished work) opened up possibilities for Kant. These conceptual possibilities in Newton are not plumbed by Newton himself, but they resonate strongly with some of Kant’s distinctive innovations." ([p.422][312s])

"The core of my claim here, regarding significant philosophical paral- lels, is that one can turn Kant’s statements into a description of the New- ton’s divine sensorium, simply by replacing the reference to our minds, with a reference to the divine mind. Consider the parallels: space is dependent upon the (divine/human) perceiving mind; it is the form of (divine/human) intuition, rather than being derived from the objects of (divine/human) cog- nition; as the form of (divine/human) intuition, space exists prior to and independently of objects. Space is infinite and one, in that it is coextensive with the presence of (divine/human) mind." ([p.427][386h])

"It needs to be underlined emphatically that my claim is _not_ that Kant uses Newton’s divine _sensorium_ to illuminate the nature of the _divine_ mind or the status of space in relation to the divine mind. Not only am I positively not saying this, but I am positively insisting that it is not the case. Rather, the claim is that Kant relocates the model of the divine _sensorium_ to the human noumenal mind, where—Kant seems to think—it fits more appropriately, so that, in his own words, ‘‘the concept of space accomplishes in the sensible world what the divine omnipresence does in the noumenal world.’’68
    Note 68 – Kant, ‘‘Metaphysik Mrongovius,’’ in Lectures on Metaphysics, 107–286" ([p.432][356t])

"That space is a form of intuition dependent upon our minds is usually characterized, not inaccurately, with the emphasis on mind dependence, against the view that space is in things-in-themselves. Attending to Kant’s own reflections on Newton’s divine sensorium model introduces the intri- guing possibility of another emphasis: that space is a form of intuition dependent upon our minds, rather than the divine mind. Newton could have helped Kant to put space on a proper mind-dependent footing (from Kant’s point of view), albeit the wrong sort of mind. By moving the human mind into an appropriately adapted conceptual space opened up by New- ton, Kant considers that he has guaranteed our knowledge of spatiality, and the possibility of divine and human freedom." ([p.437][384e])  

[384e]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/insole2011.pdf#25

"When Kant read Newton (and Clarke), so I will argue, the following con- ceptual space could have been opened up for him: space is neither a sub- stance nor an accident, but is the way in which objects are present to the (divine) mind. Space is the divine sensorium, the means by which God is present to the creation. Space is a consequence of the existence of (divine) mind, and that objects have a spatial form occurs insofar as objects are dependent upon and known by (divine) mind. The argument of this article is that such a conceptual space, transposed (with some modifications) to the human cognitive mind, might plausibly—both philosophically and his- torically speaking—have helped Kant along the road to transcendental ide- alism."

## Important ##  


**Important:**    
"Then in a note dated around 1770 Kant explicitly refers to Newton’s account of space as the omnipresent sensorium of God.57



**Important:**    
"The clear implication is that by moving space over to the human noumenal mind, God is protected from space and time (perhaps protected, in particular, from a Newtonian conception of space as the divine rather than the human _sensorium_). We see this in an intriguing note in Kant’s copy of the first _Critique_, where Kant propounds the view that space is ‘‘attributed to things only insofar as they appear to us’’ (A27/B43): ‘‘Field of space and of time. . . . Both cannot extend further than to objects of the senses, thus not to God.’’69 If space is a condition ‘‘of all existence in general,’’ Kant worries, then it would also have to be a condition ‘‘of the existence of God’’ (B72).70

    Note 70 – See Paul Guyer’s discussion of this passage, Kant and the Claims of Knowledge (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 352–54." ([p.432][571k])

**Interesting:**    
"God is not space, Newton insists, and neither is space a property of God. Rather space is the form of divine presence, such that God’s omni- presence constitutes space" ([p.417][512c])  

[512c]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/insole2011.pdf#5

**Quote:**    
"He [God] is eternal and infinite; omnipotent and omniscient; that is, his duration reaches from eternity to eternity; his presence from infinity to infinity . . . He is not eternity and infinity, but eternal and infinite; he is not duration or space, but he endures and is present. He endures for ever, and is everywhere present, and by existing always and everywhere, he constitutes duration and space.14" ([p.417][553q])  

[553q]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/insole2011.pdf#5

**Quote:**    
". . . there is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent, omnipresent, who in infinite space, as it were in his sensory, sees the things them- selves intimately, and thoroughly perceives them, and comprehends them wholly by their immediate presence to himself: of which things the images only carried through the organs of sense into our little sensoriums, are there seen and beheld by that which in us perceives and thinks.8 
Note 8 – Newton, ‘‘Extracts from the Optiks: End of Query 28 (1706),’’ in The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, ed. H. G. Alexander (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1956), 171–83, 174. References are given first of all to the number and paragraph of Leibniz’s letter (or Clarke’s corresponding reply), and then to the page number in the edition used. The paragraph numbers refer primarily to Leibniz’s letters (‘‘papers’’), with Clarke’s responses structured as a reply to each paragraph, or group of paragraphs.

God . . . who being in all places is able by his will to move the bodies within his boundless uniform sensorium.9

**Quote:**    
"If ever space had not existed, God at that time would have been nowhere; and hence he either created space later (in which he was not himself), or else, which is not less repugnant to reason, he created his own ubiquity. Next, although we can possibly imagine that there is nothing in space, yet we cannot think that space does not exist, just as we cannot think that there is no duration, even though it would be possible to suppose that nothing whatever endures.16

**Quote:**    
"‘‘Space,’’ Clarke explains, is not the ‘‘organ which God makes use of to perceive things by,’’ as God has no ‘‘need of any medium at all, whereby to perceive things.’’27 It is rather by ‘‘his immediate presence’’ to all things that God ‘‘perceives all things’’: ‘‘he being actually present to the things themselves, to all things in the universe; as the mind of man is present to all the pictures of things formed in his brain.’’28
Note 27 & 28 – Clarke, V: 3, 12–13" ([p.420][558c])

**Interesting:**    
"For Newton and Clarke, space is not a property of substances, but of divine presence. We only need to tilt the vocabulary a little to say that space is not in things-in-themselves, but is a feature of the way in which (divine) mind is present to those things that it has brought into existence. Although there are significant differences in Kant’s conception of space—as arising not from the divine, but the human mind—there are parallels in the search for a category that is, in Newton’s words, neither ‘‘substance [n]or accident’’ without being ‘‘nothing at all,’’35 with the presence of mind providing that something." ([p.421][586u])

**Disagree:**    
"To be slightly sensationalist about things: New- ton, on a plausible reading, has discovered a prototype for transcendental idealism, albeit applied to the divine mind.

CPM – this is *rather* sensationalist. Better would be to say that Newton has articulated a prototype of transcendental idealism in the sense that he has articulated a particular kind of *idealism* --- viz. space (and time?) as a feature of God's mind." ([p.422][596b])

**Quote:**    
"It is therefore to be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances, not as a determination dependent on them, and is an a priori representation that necessarily grounds outer appearances. (A24/B39)" ([p.423][538v])

**Quote:**    
"That space and time of course have objective reality, but not for what pertains to things outside of their relation [Relation] to our faculty of cognition, but rather only in relation to it, and thus to the form of sensibility, hence solely as appearances.43

**Interesting:**    
"In order for space to be considered real and objective, it is sufficient that it is the universally necessary consequence/ condition of divine/human perception." ([p.425][558a])  

[558a]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/insole2011.pdf#13

**Interesting:**    
"For Newton, space must be infinite and one, just because it is not created. As an uncreated necessary emanation of divine existence (as explained above), it necessarily shares features of God’s existence.46 Space as the divine sensorium will necessarily be coextensive with God’s unity and omniscience: there is only one God, and God is present every- where. There is just one divine formal intuition of the outer world, which is space." ([p.426][546z])

**Quote:**    
"In R 4189 (1769–70?) there is a less fragmentary reflection on space as a consequence of omnipresence: "Because we intuitively cognize not merely the space of the object that affects our senses, but the whole of space, space must not merely arise from the real affection of the senses, but rather must precede it. Because, however, it is still represented as something real, it will be the effect of the feeling of omnipresence; and time will be the effect of the dependence of all things on the existence of one, just as space is the consequence of the community of things."56

"From around 1775–57 there is another fragment, where Kant’s thoughts jump across a range of allusions: ‘‘Substance, accident, relation. Ideality of space . . .

**Quote:**    
"First of all, from the "Inaugural Dissertation":59

space, which is the sensitively cognised universal and necessary cognition of the co-presence of all things, can be called PHENOMENAL OMNIPRESENCE. (For the cause of the universe is not present to each and every thing simply in virtue of the fact that that cause is in the places in which they are. It is rather the case that places exist, that is to say, that relations of substances are possible, because the cause of the universe is inwardly present to all things).60

**Quote:**    
"from the ‘‘Metaphysics Lectures’’61 of the mid-1770s we have the following: As phenomenon, space is the infinite connection of substances with each other. Through the understanding we comprehend only their connection, to the extent they all lie in the divine. This is the only ground for comprehending the connection of substances through the understanding, to the extent we intuit the substances as though they lay generally in the divine. If we imagine this connection _sensibly_, then it happens through space. Thus space is the highest condition of the _possibility_ of the connection. Now if we sensibly represent the connection of substances, which consists in this, that God is present to all things, then we can say: _space is the phenomenon of the divine [omni]presence_.62

**Interesting:**    
"Kant is reflecting, in this part of his lectures, on the parallel way in which for noumenal selves to be in connection with one another, there must be a medium of reciprocal connection. This medium of reciprocal connection cannot be space, as space pertains only to the sensible/phenomenal realm: space is the form by which we experience the world, and so can be the medium through which causation—as we experience it—occurs. But space, and the causation that it makes possible, are not features of the world in itself. In fact, the medium for the reciprocal connection of noumenal selves is the ‘‘divine omnipresence.’’ Space is the ‘‘phenomenon of omnipresence’’ because it does in the phenomenal realm what God’s omnipresence does in the noumenal."

**Interesting:**    
"Kant seems to be convinced that if God is (directly) the creator of space, space will become an unacceptable condition of God’s own existence. It is not enough that space is not a necessary ema- nation of the divine existence; space must also not be a direct product of the divine creation." ([p.433][567i])

**Quote:**    
"In a ‘‘Reflection’’ from around 1778–80 we find Kant explicitly putting in place a protective buffer between the creator and created space, by denying that God is directly the creator of space, rather than of beings in whom space is a form of intuition: Whatever God did is good, but it does not lie in the sensible world as a mere schema of the intelligible world. Thus space is nothing in itself and is not a thing as a divine work, but rather lies in us and can only obtain in us. . . . The appearances are not actually creations, thus neither is the human being; rather he is merely the appearance of a divine creation. His condition of acting and being acted upon is an appearance and depends on him as bodies de- pend on space. The human being is the _principium originarium_ of appearances.71" ([p.433][546e])

**Quote:**    
"On a number of occasions Kant is keen to reject the Newtonian model of space as a consequence of divine cognition, on related grounds. In Reflection 6285 from the mid/ late-1780s Kant writes that: [Newton and Clarke] regarded infinite space as a property or attribute of God, that is, as his sensorium.—But since in the infinite Being no determination can be thought that contradicts the concept of metaphysical infinity, and since extension and spatiality are to be regarded as such determinations, so they cannot be ascribed to God, and cannot be properties of God.72

"Kant provides references to Newton’s _Opticks_ (the divine sensorium passage in query 28), and to the _Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence_. The Reflection itself is given as an observation on the following passage: Things in space are all bound a priori to the conditions of space. Were space something in itself, it would be necessary, and even God in his being would be bound to it. God must be present to things in themselves and so therefore to thinking beings, and therefore, God must make the idea of space a necessary determination of the outer intuition of thinking beings.73

**Quote:**    
"In his ‘‘Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion’’77 (1785– 86), Kant explicitly combines observations about the parallels and discontinuities between Newton’s view of space, and transcendental idealism. Kant draws attention to Newton’s sensorium model, rejecting it in the case of God (because God cannot be passive), but applying it to the human being: . . . if God is the most perfect spirit, then he cannot be thought of as in space. For space is only a condition of the sensible appearance of things.—Newton says in one place that space is the sensorium of God’s omnipresence. . . . Such a representation of God’s omnipresence, however, is most inappropriate; for it would regard God as the soul of the world, and space as his sensorium. For if God were the soul of the world, then he would have to stand in commercio with the world and all the things in it, i.e. he would not only operate on those things but receive their operations as well. . . . It is not easy to see how such a thing could be brought into agreement with the impassibility of a highest being.78
