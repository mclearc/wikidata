In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mathematics, understood as
being composed fundamentally by the study of discrete magnitudes (
arithmetic) and continuous magnitudes (geometry), was considered a
paradigm of science. The term 'science' (or *scientia*) denoted a
systematically organized body of knowledge, consisting of some set of
known fundamental concepts (definitions) and propositions derived from
these concepts. A science articulated not only some set of facts
concerning the subject matter of the relevant domain---what we might
call 'knowledge *that*'---it also articulated explanations of the
relevant subject matter---'knowlege *why*'.[^12557] 

[^12557]: The model of science stems originally from Aristotle's *
Posterior Analytics*. See @de-jong2010; @shabel2005. 

Kant makes three significant claims concerning the prevailing view of
mathematical knowledge. He argues that,

1. Mathematical knowledge is a priori
2. Mathematical knowledge is synthetic
3. Mathematical method is unique

Though (1) was not disputed by any of the major theoreticians of Kant's
day, it stood in need of explanation, which Kant took his critical
philosophy to be uniquely suited to supply. (2) was highly contested,
and an original contribution of Kant's to the study of the foundations
of mathematics. (3) was also quite controversial, and went against the
predominant philosophies present in Germany and other areas of the
European continent (Descartes and Spinoza being the most salient
examples). We'll take these issues in turn, looking both at Kant's
arguments and the historical context necessary for understanding those
arguments.

# Rationalist Philosophy of Mathematics #

A dominant research program amongst philosophers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries accounted for mathematical knowledge in terms of the
possession and analysis of concepts. Kant's view is largely articulated in
opposition to this broadly rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge.
One of the most influential philosophers in Germany prior to Kant, [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754),
articulated a theory of mathematical knowledge in which all mathematical
(including geometrical) knowledge could be demonstrated in terms of explicit,
step-by-step inferences from the contents of our mathematical concepts,
which could be reconstructed in classical syllogistic form. 

The rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge thus construed
mathematical knowledge as a priori, insofar as the justification of
mathematical judgment did not derive from particular experiences, but
only from *concepts*, and their construction or analysis.[^132559]
Mathematical knowledge was also construed as entirely *analytic*. All
true mathematical judgments were simply explications of the content of a
mathematical concept where the predicate of the concept was either
explicitly or implicitly 'contained' in the subject.[^133710]

[^133710]: See also the discussion of [containment analyticity](Kant\'s Project#containment-analyticity)

[^132559]: This conception of mathematical justification is compatible with the
*content* of the relevant mathematical concepts as itself derived from
experience. However, many rationalists concerning mathematical justification
were also nativists concerning mathematical concepts (e.g. Descartes, Spinoza ,
and Leibniz), so they combine an a priori account of the justification of
mathematical judgments with a nativist account of the acquisition of the
relevant concepts composing the relevant mathematical propositions.
These two doctrines were obviously mutually supporting. 

So, according to the rationalist programme, mathematical knowledge is
both a priori and analytic. What's more, its a priority is *explained by*
its analyticity. However, there are several basic problems with the
resulting position. 

First, one might reasonably wonder how knowledge gained by the mere
analysis of concepts could be shown to apply to the empirical world, and
apply to it with universal and absolute certainty. In other words,
explaining mathematical knowledge in terms of analyticity seems to rob
us of any explanation of its application to empirical reality. One might
attempt to avoid this problem by arguing that there is a guarantee of '
fit' between our concepts and the nature of the world---that the
conceptual order tracks the real order---but this claim itself is highly
dubious, or at least became so after criticisms stemming from Locke,
Hume, and Kant.[^15344]

[^15344]: For criticisms from Locke see the [SEP
overview](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-philosophy-science/) of his
conception of scientific knowledge. Hume's most famous criticism is of our
concept of causation (see the [SEP
entry](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau)). Kant's criticisms will be
discussed later in the semester.

Second, one might plausibly worry that any attempt to deny the analyticity of
mathematics and show mathematical concepts as applying to empirical reality
might rob any putative mathematical knowledge of universality and necessity.
How could knowledge which has its source in our experience of the world even
tell us anything about how the unexperienced world is or how things must be
rather than how they contingently are?

Kant tries to show both that the rationalist programme cannot give a
convincing answer to these questions and that his own transcendental
idealism can.

# Kant against Logicism #


## Mathematics as Synthetic ##


## Mathematics as A Priori ##


# Philosophy and Mathematics #

Kant is deeply critical of the prevailing view in Germany that philosophy and
mathematics share similar aims and methods, and that philosophical questions
may be pursued with the same tools that the mathematician uses in the course of
giving mathematical proofs. This was true both of philosophers outside of
Germany, such as Descartes and Spinoza, and philosophers inside Germany, such
as Leibniz and Wolff. [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754) is
perhaps the figure Kant most clearly has in mind in his criticisms of
philosophical practice modeled on mathematics.
