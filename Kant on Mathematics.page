In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mathematics, understood as
being composed fundamentally by the study of discrete magnitudes (
arithmetic) and continuous magnitudes (geometry), was considered a
paradigm of science. The term 'science' (or *scientia*) denoted a
systematically organized body of knowledge, consisting of some set of
known fundamental concepts (definitions) and propositions derived from
these concepts. A science articulated not only some set of facts
concerning the subject matter of the relevant domain---what we might
call 'knowledge *that*'---it also articulated explanations of the
relevant subject matter---'knowlege *why*'.[^12557] 

[^12557]: The model of science stems originally from Aristotle's *
Posterior Analytics*. See @de-jong2010; @shabel2005. 

Kant makes three significant claims concerning the prevailing view of
mathematical knowledge. He argues that,

1. Mathematical knowledge is a priori
2. Mathematical knowledge is synthetic
3. Mathematical method is unique

Though (1) was not disputed by any of the major theoreticians of Kant's
day, it stood in need of explanation, which Kant took his critical
philosophy to be uniquely suited to supply. (2) was highly contested,
and an original contribution of Kant's to the study of the foundations
of mathematics. (3) was also quite controversial, and went against the
predominant philosophies present in Germany and other areas of the
European continent (Descartes and Spinoza being the most salient
examples). We'll take these issues in turn, looking both at Kant's
arguments and the historical context necessary for understanding those
arguments.

# Rationalist Philosophy of Mathematics #

A dominant research program amongst philosophers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries accounted for mathematical knowledge in terms of the
possession and analysis of concepts. Kant's view is largely articulated in
opposition to this broadly rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge.
One of the most influential philosophers in Germany prior to Kant, [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754),
articulated a theory of mathematical knowledge in which all mathematical
(including geometrical) knowledge could be demonstrated in terms of explicit,
step-by-step inferences from the contents of our mathematical concepts,
which could be reconstructed in classical syllogistic form. 

The rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge thus construed
mathematical knowledge as a priori, insofar as the justification of
mathematical judgment did not derive from particular experiences, but
only from *concepts*, and their construction or analysis.[^132559]
Mathematical knowledge was also construed as entirely *analytic*. All
true mathematical judgments were simply explications of the content of a
mathematical concept where the predicate of the concept was either
explicitly or implicitly 'contained' in the subject.[^133710]

[^133710]: See also the discussion of [containment analyticity](Kant\'s Project#containment-analyticity)

[^132559]: This conception of mathematical justification is compatible with the
*content* of the relevant mathematical concepts as itself derived from
experience. However, many rationalists concerning mathematical justification
were also nativists concerning mathematical concepts (e.g. Descartes, Spinoza ,
and Leibniz), so they combine an a priori account of the justification of
mathematical judgments with a nativist account of the acquisition of the
relevant concepts composing the relevant mathematical propositions.
These two doctrines were obviously mutually supporting. 

So, according to the rationalist programme, mathematical knowledge is
both a priori and analytic. What's more, its a priority is *explained by*
its analyticity. However, there are several basic problems with the
resulting position. 

First, one might reasonably wonder how knowledge gained by the mere
analysis of concepts could be shown to apply to the empirical world, and
apply to it with universal and absolute certainty. In other words,
explaining mathematical knowledge in terms of analyticity seems to rob
us of any explanation of its application to empirical reality. One might
attempt to avoid this problem by arguing that there is a guarantee of '
fit' between our concepts and the nature of the world---that the
conceptual order tracks the real order---but this claim itself is highly
dubious, or at least became so after criticisms stemming from Locke,
Hume, and Kant.[^15344]

[^15344]: For criticisms from Locke see the [SEP
overview](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-philosophy-science/) of his
conception of scientific knowledge. Hume's most famous criticism is of our
concept of causation (see the [SEP
entry](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau)). Kant's criticisms will be
discussed later in the semester.

Second, one might plausibly worry that any attempt to deny the analyticity of
mathematics and show mathematical concepts as applying to empirical reality
might rob any putative mathematical knowledge of universality and necessity.
How could knowledge which has its source in our experience of the world even
tell us anything about how the unexperienced world is or how things must be
rather than how they contingently are?

Kant tries to show both that the rationalist programme cannot give a
convincing answer to these questions and that his own transcendental
idealism can.

# Kant on Mathematical Knowledge #

We'll look first at Kant's criticism of the rationalist's analyticity
claim and then move to his defense of the a priori status of
mathematical knowledge, despite its 'synthetic' basis. 

## Mathematics as Synthetic ##

Kant rejects the idea that substantive mathematical knowledge may be
derived from the mere analysis of concepts. This means that Kant must
claim that mathematical knowledge is of propositions wherein the subject
concept does not 'contain' the predicate, despite the latter's 'belonging'
to the subject in a manner necessary for truth.[^235932]

### The Argument from Arithmetic ###

>To be sure, one might initially think that the proposition "7 + 5 = 12" is a
>merely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum of seven
>and five in accordance with the principle of contradiction. Yet if one
>considers it more closely, one finds that the concept of the sum of 7 and 5
>contains nothing more than the unification of both numbers in a single one,
>through which it is not at all thought what this single number is which
>comprehends the two of them. The concept of twelve is by no means already
>thought merely by my thinking of that unification of seven and five, and no
>matter how long I analyze my concept of such a possible sum I will still not
>find twelve in it. One must go beyond these concepts, seeking assistance in
>the intuition that corresponds to one of the two, one's five fingers, say, or
>(as in Segner's arithmetic) five points, and one after another add the units
>of the five given in the intuition to the concept of seven. (B15)

### The Argument from Geometry ###

>Geometry is a science that determines the properties of space synthetically
>and yet *a priori*. What then must the representation of space be for such a
>cognition of it to be possible? It must originally be intuition; for from a
>mere concept no propositions can be drawn that go beyond the concept, which,
>however, happens in geometry (Introduction V). But this intuition must be
>encountered in us *a priori*, i.e., prior to all perception of an object, thus
>it must be pure, not empirical intuition. For geometrical propositions are all
>apodictic, i.e., combined with consciousness of their necessity, e.g., space
>has only three dimensions; but such propositions cannot be empirical or
>judgments of experience, nor inferred from them (Introduction II). (B41)

### The Argument from Transcendental Realism ###

>Those, however, who assert the absolute reality of space and time, whether
>they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, must themselves come into
>conflict with the principles of experience. For if they decide in favor of the
>first (which is generally the position of the mathematical investigators of
>nature), then they must assume two eternal and infinite self-subsisting
>non-entities (space and time), which exist (yet without there being anything
>real) only in order to comprehend everything real within themselves. If they
>adopt the second position (as do some metaphysicians of nature), and hold
>space and time to be relations of appearances (next to or successive to one
>another) that are abstracted from experience though confusedly represented in
>this abstraction, then they must dispute the validity or at least the
>apodictic certainty of *a priori* mathematical doctrines in regard to real
>things (e.g., in space), since this certainty does not occur *a posteriori*,
>and on this view the *a priori* concepts of space and time are only creatures
>of the imagination, the origin of which must really be sought in experience,
>out of whose abstracted relations imagination has made something that, to be
>sure, contains what is general in them but that cannot occur without the
>restrictions that nature has attached to them. The first succeed in opening
>the field of appearances for mathematical assertions.a However, they
>themselves become very confused through precisely these conditions if the
>understanding would go beyond this field. The second succeed, to be sure, with
>respect to the latter, in that the representations of space and time do not
>stand in their way if they would judge of objects not as appearances but
>merely in relation to the understanding; but they can neither offer any ground
>for the possibility of *a priori* mathematical cognitions (since they lack a
>true and objectively valid *a priori* intuition), nor can they bring the
>propositions o f experience into necessary accord with those assertions. On
>our theory of the true constitution of these two original forms of sensibility
>both difficulties are remedied. (A39-41/B56-8)

## Mathematics as A Priori ##

Kant gives a brief defense of the a priori status of mathematics in the
B-Introduction.

>Properly mathematical judgments are always *a priori* judgments and are never
>empirical, because they carry necessity with them, which cannot be derived
>from experience. But if one does not want to concede this, well then, I will
>restrict my proposition to pure mathematics, the concept of which already
>implies that it does not contain empirical but merely pure *a priori*
>cognition. (B 14–15)

This argument looks like so much table-pounding. If one were not already
convinced of the universality and necessity of mathematical knowledge
then it is difficult to see how this 'argument' would persuade. In Kant'
s defense, the apriority claim was never in much doubt. Even Hume
defended the claim that mathematical knowlege was a priori insofar as
they were true

>by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere
>existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in
>nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their
>certainty and evidence. (E IV.i.1)

But Hume considered mathematical knowledge to be purely analytic. So he
had a ready explanation for how it could be universal and certain. Since
Kant has rejected the account of mathematical justification in terms of
analyticity he needs to provide some other means of explaining the a
priori status of mathematics. He does this through his account of
mathematical construction in pure intuition, to which we'll now turn.

## Construction in Pure Intuition ##



# Philosophy and Mathematics #

Kant is deeply critical of the prevailing view in Germany that philosophy and
mathematics share similar aims and methods, and that philosophical questions
may be pursued with the same tools that the mathematician uses in the course of
giving mathematical proofs. This was true both of philosophers outside of
Germany, such as Descartes and Spinoza, and philosophers inside Germany, such
as Leibniz and Wolff. [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754) is
perhaps the figure Kant most clearly has in mind in his criticisms of
philosophical practice modeled on mathematics.
