In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mathematics, understood as
being composed fundamentally by the study of discrete magnitudes 
(arithmetic) and continuous magnitudes (geometry), was considered a
paradigm of science. The term 'science' (or *scientia*) denoted a
systematically organized body of knowledge, consisting of some set of
known fundamental concepts (definitions) and propositions derived from
these concepts. A science articulated not only some set of facts
concerning the subject matter of the relevant domain---what we might
call 'knowledge *that*'---it also articulated explanations of the
relevant subject matter---'knowlege *why*'.[^12557] 

[^12557]: The model of science stems originally from Aristotle's *
Posterior Analytics*. See @de-jong2010; @shabel2005. See also the entry
on 
[science](The Medieval Background to Modern Philosophy#demonstrative-science) from [The Medieval Background to Modern Philosophy]().

Kant makes three significant claims concerning the prevailing view of
mathematical knowledge. He argues that,

1. Mathematical knowledge is a priori
2. Mathematical knowledge is synthetic
3. Mathematical method is unique

Though (1) was not disputed by any of the major theoreticians of Kant's
day, it stood in need of explanation, which Kant took his critical
philosophy to be uniquely suited to supply. (2) was highly contested,
and an original contribution of Kant's to the study of the foundations
of mathematics. (3) was also quite controversial, and went against the
predominant philosophies present in Germany and other areas of the
European continent (Descartes and Spinoza being the most salient
examples). We'll take these issues in turn, looking both at Kant's
arguments and the historical context necessary for understanding those
arguments.

# Rationalist Philosophy of Mathematics #

A dominant research program amongst philosophers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries accounted for mathematical knowledge in terms of the
possession and analysis of concepts. Kant's view is largely articulated in
opposition to this broadly rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge.
One of the most influential philosophers in Germany prior to Kant, [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754),
articulated a theory of mathematical knowledge in which all mathematical
(including geometrical) knowledge could be demonstrated in terms of explicit,
step-by-step inferences from the contents of our mathematical concepts,
which could be reconstructed in classical syllogistic form. 

The rationalist conception of mathematical knowledge thus construed
mathematical knowledge as a priori, insofar as the justification of
mathematical judgment did not derive from particular experiences, but
only from *concepts*, and their construction or analysis.[^132559]
Mathematical knowledge was also construed as entirely *analytic*. All
true mathematical judgments were simply explications of the content of a
mathematical concept where the predicate of the concept was either
explicitly or implicitly 'contained' in the subject.[^133710]

[^133710]: See also the discussion of [containment analyticity](Kant\'s Project#containment-analyticity)

[^132559]: This conception of mathematical justification is compatible with the
*content* of the relevant mathematical concepts as itself derived from
experience. However, many rationalists concerning mathematical justification
were also nativists concerning mathematical concepts (e.g. Descartes, Spinoza ,
and Leibniz), so they combine an a priori account of the justification of
mathematical judgments with a nativist account of the acquisition of the
relevant concepts composing the relevant mathematical propositions.
These two doctrines were obviously mutually supporting. 

So, according to the rationalist programme, mathematical knowledge is
both a priori and analytic. What's more, its a priority is *explained by*
its analyticity. However, there are several basic problems with the
resulting position. 

First, one might reasonably wonder how knowledge gained by the mere
analysis of concepts could be shown to apply to the empirical world, and
apply to it with universal and absolute certainty. In other words,
explaining mathematical knowledge in terms of analyticity seems to rob
us of any explanation of its application to empirical reality. One might
attempt to avoid this problem by arguing that there is a guarantee of '
fit' between our concepts and the nature of the world---that the
conceptual order tracks the real order---but this claim itself is highly
dubious, or at least became so after criticisms stemming from Locke,
Hume, and Kant.[^15344]

[^15344]: For criticisms from Locke see the [SEP
overview](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-philosophy-science/) of his
conception of scientific knowledge. Hume's most famous criticism is of our
concept of causation (see the [SEP
entry](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau)). Kant's criticisms will be
discussed later in the semester.

Second, one might plausibly worry that any attempt to deny the analyticity of
mathematics and show mathematical concepts as applying to empirical reality
might rob any putative mathematical knowledge of universality and necessity.
How could knowledge which has its source in our experience of the world even
tell us anything about how the unexperienced world is or how things must be
rather than how they contingently are?

Kant tries to show both that the rationalist programme cannot give a
convincing answer to these questions and that his own transcendental
idealism can.

# Kant on Mathematical Knowledge #

We'll look first at Kant's criticism of the rationalist's analyticity
claim and then move to his defense of the a priori status of
mathematical knowledge, despite its 'synthetic' basis. 

## Mathematics as Synthetic ##

Kant rejects the idea that substantive mathematical knowledge may be
derived from the mere analysis of concepts. This means that Kant must
claim that mathematical knowledge is of propositions wherein the subject
concept does not 'contain' the predicate, despite the latter's 'belonging'
to the subject in a manner necessary for truth.[^235932] 


[^235932]: Cf. @shabel2006, [98](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf?page=5)


### The Argument from Arithmetic ###

In the B-Introduction to the CPR Kant argues that no analysis of
concepts could ever suffice for an account of our knowledge of an
arithmetical sum. 

>To be sure, one might initially think that the proposition "7 + 5 = 12" is a
>merely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum of seven
>and five in accordance with the principle of contradiction. Yet if one
>considers it more closely, one finds that the concept of the sum of 7 and 5
>contains nothing more than the unification of both numbers in a single one,
>through which it is not at all thought what this single number is which
>comprehends the two of them. The concept of twelve is by no means already
>thought merely by my thinking of that unification of seven and five, and no
>matter how long I analyze my concept of such a possible sum I will still not
>find twelve in it. One must go beyond these concepts, seeking assistance in
>the intuition that corresponds to one of the two, one's five fingers, say, or
>(as in Segner's arithmetic) five points, and one after another add the units
>of the five given in the intuition to the concept of seven. (B15)

More generally, his argument seems to be that for any arithmetical proposition,
our knowledge of the meanings of the component numerical concepts and
arithmetic operators could never suffice for knowledge of the result of the
arithmetical operation. But is this a convincing argument? Should we really
even call it an *argument* rather than merely a *challenge* to a rationalist
theory?

First, and briefly, it seems clear that '7 + 5 = m - n' will be totally
unobvious for any large number substituted for m and n, indeed, they may
be numbers no one has ever thought of. So in such cases it seems clear
that the thought of the predicate is not contained in thought of the
subject, at least in terms of anything the subject might infer or be aware
of.[^14278]

[^14278]: @van-cleve1999, [22](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/van%20cleve1999.pdf?page=34)

Second, and related to our previous discussion of 
[containment analyticity](Kant's Project#containment-analyticity), 
Kant's argument is that in the proposition '7 + 5 = 12' the concept `<7+5>`
is not contained in `<12>` in the manner required by a conceptual division
which would locate `<7+5>` on a conceptual hierarchy above `<12>` according
to rules of logical division. For example the analysis of '7 + 5 = 12' might
look something like the following:

![](/Users/Roambot/Dropbox/Webpage/content/images/number.png "Analysis of '7 + 5 = 12'")

According to Kant, the problem is that the point of the mathematical
proposition '7 + 5 = 12' is to assert a specific relation amongst the three
numbers. But the hierarchy above can represent no such relation. Worse, any
attempt to assert a relation in the hierarchy between `<5>`, `<7>`, `<7+5>`,
and `<12>` will result in an overlap of the extensions of `<5>`, `<7>`, `<7+5>`
in the concept `<7+5>`, and thus a violation of the division rules guaranteeing
analyticity. Consider this diagram:

![](/Users/Roambot/Dropbox/Webpage/content/images/sum.png)

`<5>` and `<7>` cannot be contained in `<7+5>` the way that `<12>` is, for then
`<5>` and `<7>` would also be *sums* of `<7+5>`. But the hierarchy has no other
way of relating the concepts. `<5>` and `<7>` must be contained in `<7+5>` in
some other manner than that which the analytical hierarchy can
represent.[^151317]

[^151317]: For further discussion of what this 'other manner' might be see
@anderson2004, [530-1](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/anderson2004.pdf?page=30).

### The Argument from Geometry ###

>Geometry is a science that determines the properties of space synthetically
>and yet *a priori*. What then must the representation of space be for such a
>cognition of it to be possible? It must originally be intuition; for from a
>mere concept no propositions can be drawn that go beyond the concept, which,
>however, happens in geometry (Introduction V). But this intuition must be
>encountered in us *a priori*, i.e., prior to all perception of an object, thus
>it must be pure, not empirical intuition. For geometrical propositions are all
>apodictic, i.e., combined with consciousness of their necessity, e.g., space
>has only three dimensions; but such propositions cannot be empirical or
>judgments of experience, nor inferred from them (Introduction II). (B41)

### The Argument from Transcendental Realism ###

>Those, however, who assert the absolute reality of space and time, whether
>they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, must themselves come into
>conflict with the principles of experience. For if they decide in favor of the
>first (which is generally the position of the mathematical investigators of
>nature), then they must assume two eternal and infinite self-subsisting
>non-entities (space and time), which exist (yet without there being anything
>real) only in order to comprehend everything real within themselves. If they
>adopt the second position (as do some metaphysicians of nature), and hold
>space and time to be relations of appearances (next to or successive to one
>another) that are abstracted from experience though confusedly represented in
>this abstraction, then they must dispute the validity or at least the
>apodictic certainty of *a priori* mathematical doctrines in regard to real
>things (e.g., in space), since this certainty does not occur *a posteriori*,
>and on this view the *a priori* concepts of space and time are only creatures
>of the imagination, the origin of which must really be sought in experience,
>out of whose abstracted relations imagination has made something that, to be
>sure, contains what is general in them but that cannot occur without the
>restrictions that nature has attached to them. The first succeed in opening
>the field of appearances for mathematical assertions.a However, they
>themselves become very confused through precisely these conditions if the
>understanding would go beyond this field. The second succeed, to be sure, with
>respect to the latter, in that the representations of space and time do not
>stand in their way if they would judge of objects not as appearances but
>merely in relation to the understanding; but they can neither offer any ground
>for the possibility of *a priori* mathematical cognitions (since they lack a
>true and objectively valid *a priori* intuition), nor can they bring the
>propositions o f experience into necessary accord with those assertions. On
>our theory of the true constitution of these two original forms of sensibility
>both difficulties are remedied. (A39-41/B56-8)

## Mathematics as A Priori ##

Kant gives a brief defense of the a priori status of mathematics in the
B-Introduction.

>Properly mathematical judgments are always *a priori* judgments and are never
>empirical, because they carry necessity with them, which cannot be derived
>from experience. But if one does not want to concede this, well then, I will
>restrict my proposition to pure mathematics, the concept of which already
>implies that it does not contain empirical but merely pure *a priori*
>cognition. (B 14–15)

This argument looks like so much table-pounding. If one were not already
convinced of the universality and necessity of mathematical knowledge
then it is difficult to see how this 'argument' would persuade. In Kant'
s defense, the apriority claim was never in much doubt. Even Hume
defended the claim that mathematical knowlege was a priori insofar as
they were true

>by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere
>existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in
>nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their
>certainty and evidence. (E IV.i.1)

But Hume considered mathematical knowledge to be purely analytic. So he
had a ready explanation for how it could be universal and certain. Since
Kant has rejected the account of mathematical justification in terms of
analyticity he needs to provide some other means of explaining the a
priori status of mathematics. He does this through his account of
mathematical construction in pure intuition. This account goes hand in
hand with his argument for the uniqueness of mathematical methodology, to which we'll now turn.

# Philosophy and Mathematics #

Kant is deeply critical of the prevailing view in Germany that philosophy and
mathematics share similar aims and methods, and that philosophical questions
may be pursued with the same tools that the mathematician uses in the course of
giving mathematical proofs. This was true both of philosophers outside of
Germany, such as Descartes and Spinoza, and philosophers inside Germany, such
as Leibniz and Wolff. [Christian
Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754) is
perhaps the figure Kant most clearly has in mind in his criticisms of
philosophical practice modeled on mathematics. 

There are two central differences between mathematics and philosophy
according to Kant. The first concerns the availability and nature of the
definitions of the concepts concerning their relevant subject matter.
The second concerns the role of intuition in presenting the objects of
these concepts. We'll take these in turn. 

## Definition and Exposition ##

Kant thinks that there are important differences between the
mathematical and philosophical spheres of inquiry such that the method
of mathematics cannot be easily transported to
philosophy---specifically, metaphysics. The difference centers on the
issue of definition. As Kant says in his 1763 Prize Essay,

>In mathematics I begin with the definition of my object, for example, of a
>triangle or a circle, or whatever. In metaphysics I may never begin with a
>definition. Far from being the first thing I know about the object, the
>definition is nearly always the last thing I come to know. In mathematics,
>namely, I have no concept of my object at all until it is furnished by the
>definition. In metaphysics I have a concept which is already given to me
>although it is a confused one. My task is to search for the distinct, complete
>and determinate concept. (2:283)

The concepts with which philosophy works are given to it.
Thus its definitions are arrived at analytically (2:276). In contrast, the
concepts with which mathematics works are *made*, and its concepts are
arrived at synthetically, as a result of the definition articulated.
For example, in the case of the concept `<cone>` Kant says that,

>[w]hatever the concept of cone may ordinarily signify, in mathematics the
>concept is the product of the arbitrary representation of a right-angled
>triangle which is rotated on one of its sides (2:276).[^133042]

[^133042]: Cf. @carson2006a, 10-11.

So mathematical knowledge, as Kant envisions it, does not proceed from concepts
concerning things we encounter in nature, but rather from definitions used to
construct concepts a priori.

Mathematical definition both exhaustively details the content of a
concept and provides a method for constructing its object. But the
concept itself does not prove the real possibility of its object. That
requires intuition. So in the case of philosophical analysis, the
problem isn't that the concept does not prove the real possibility of
its object, but rather that the definition which specifies the concept
(in this case, its logical essence) does not also give an a priori rule
or method for constructing the concept. We have to go and look for the
concept, and hence there is no apodeictic certainty built into the
concept, that its object is really possible. 

Kant elucidates the difference between definition and explication most
clearly in the chapter of the first *Critique* entitled 'Discipline of Pure Reason in its Dogmatic Use'.

> to **define** properly means just to exhibit originally the exhaustive
> concept of a thing within its boundaries.\* Given such a requirement,
> an **empirical** concept cannot be defined at all but only
> **explicated** [*nur **explizirt** werden*].
>
> \* **Exhaustiveness** signifies the clarity of sufficiency of marks;
> **boundaries**, the precision, that is, that there are no more of
> these than are required for the exhaustive concept; **original**,
> however, that this boundary-determination is not derived from anywhere
> else and thus in need of a proof, which would make the supposed
> definition incapable of standing at the head of all judgments about an
> object. (A727/B755)

Kant’s distinction immediately raises a number of issues. First, Kant denies
that any empirical concept could be defined, at least in part because we could
never firmly set the boundaries of the concept. So a central difference between
genuine definition and exposition or explication is that definitions are
exhaustive and fixed elaborations of the content of a concept, whereas
expositions or explications are not. Empirical concepts are subject to revision
in a way that concepts capable of definition are not. More generally, according
to Kant the philosopher (as opposed to the mathematician) can never be certain
of the exhaustiveness of their favored elaboration of a concept. Thus, though
‘we can often infer much from some marks that we have drawn from an as of yet
uncompleted analysis’ we can never certify their exhaustiveness, and thus that
‘we have arrived at a complete exposition, i.e., a definition.’ (A730/B758).

Second, and perhaps surprisingly, there are many a priori concepts that
do not admit of definition either. So the issue of definition cuts
across the boundaries between the a priori and a posteriori. For
example, Kant says

> strictly speaking no concept given a priori can be defined, e.g.,
> substance, cause, right, equity, etc. For I can never be certain that
> the distinct representation of a (still confused) given concept has
> been exhaustively developed unless I know that it is adequate to the
> object. But since the concept of the latter, as it is given, can
> contain many obscure representations, which we pass by in our analysis
> though we always use them in application, the exhaustiveness of the
> analysis of my concept is always doubtful, and by many appropriate
> examples can only be made **probably** but never **apodictically**
> certain. Instead of the expression “definition” I would rather use
> that of **exposition**…(A728-9/B756-7)

So no *a priori* concept that is given, such as any of the categories or
any of our fundamental moral concepts, can be defined. This point, along
with Kant’s denial that empirical concepts are definable, results in the
position that the only concepts capable of strict definition are those
that are *constructed*.[^31]

What concepts are constructible? Only those whose marks may be put
together in an ‘arbitrary’ or ‘elective’ [*willkurlich*] fashion.[^32]

> Since therefore neither empirical concepts nor concepts given a priori
> can be defined, there re­main none but electively thought ones for
> which one can attempt this trick. In such a case I can always define
> my concept: for I must know what I wanted to think, since I
> deliberately made it up, and it was not given to me either through the
> nature of the understanding or through experience; but I cannot say
> that I have thereby defined a true object. For if the concept depends
> upon empirical conditions, e.g., a chro­nometer, then the object and
> its possibility are not given through this elective concept; from the
> concept I do not even know whether it has an object, and my
> explanation could better be called a declaration (of my project) than
> a definition of an object (A729/B757)

Kant here admits that such elective concepts are possible in
the empirical case, but cannot count as genuine definitions. His
reasoning for this is not entirely obvious. He states first that the
‘object and its possibility’ are not given by the concept. Presumably
this is an indication that, while the empirical concept may be logically
coherent, the empirical world could be such that no entity could ever
instantiate it. In other words, the real possibility of the concept’s
object is not given by the definition of the concept.[^33] But Kant goes
on to gloss his denial in stronger terms—viz., that the concept does not
bring with its application the knowledge that it *actually* has
instantiations. But it is not at all clear why this would need to be the
case for the concept to count as a definition. Surely an engineer might
conceive of a chronometer and assiduously determine the feasibility of
its being built—i.e. that it is really possible, and yet never build
it.[^34]

In addition to these difficulties, we should also note that Kant does
seem to allow for a form of definition in the empirical case after all,
what he calls ‘logical’ or ‘nominal’ definition. Kant give the clearest
articulation of the notion of a nominal definition in the *Jäsche
Logik*.

> By mere *definitions of names*, or *nominal definitions*, are to be
> understood those that contain the meaning that one wanted arbitrarily
> to give to a certain name, and which therefore signify only the
> logical essence of their object, or which serve merely for
> distinguishing it from other objects. *Definitions of things*, or
> *real definitions*, on the other hand, are ones that suffice for
> cognition of the object according to its inner determinations, since
> they present the possibility of the object from inner marks. (JL
> 9:143; cf. LL 24:268-9; R2995, 16:607, R2999, 16:609 (c. 1770-1); C
> 11:53 (Letter to Herz, 26 May 1789))

So, if we want to provide a definition that allows us to
distinguish one thing from others, as
`<two-legged animal with broad nails>` might allow us to distinguish
human beings from other animals, then Kant concedes that we are able to
do so (cf. LL 24:270-1, 919-20). Thus when Kant denies that empirical
concepts be given definitions, he must not be taken as denying the
strong claim that no definition of an empirical concept is possible, but
rather only the weaker claim that no *real defintition* of an empirical
concept is possible.

Real definition seems to require several things. First, real definitions
are fixed, in virtue of detailing the essential properties of a thing.
Kant makes this clear in a note to the above cited discussion in the
*Jäsche Logik*

> Note 2. Objects of experience allow only nominal explanations. Logical
> nominal definitions of given concepts of the understanding are derived
> from an attribute, real definitions, on the other hand, from the
> essence of the thing, the first ground of possibility. Thus the latter
> contain what always belongs to the thing – its real essence. (JL
> 9:144)

The real definition, in virtue of detailing the real essence
of a thing, provides a fixed and unchanging articulation of the thing’s
necessary properties, the properties necessary for that thing to be the
kind of thing that it is.

We also see an indication that derivability is an important distinction
as well. Kant continues in the same note by saying,

> Merely negative definitions cannot be called real definitions either,
> because negative marks can serve just as well as affirmative ones for
> distinguishing one thing from others, but not for cognition of the
> thing according to its inner possibility. In matters of morals real
> definitions must always be sought; all our striving must be directed
> toward this. There are real definitions in mathematics, for the
> definition of an arbitrary concept is always real. (JL 9:144)

Kant denies here that thought of something via what it is
*not* cannot provide the content of a real definition because it does
not allow for ‘cognition of the thing according to its inner
possibility’. I take this to mean that it does not allow for knowledge
from a explanatory ground in the sense of Kant’s pre-critical notion of
a antecedently determining ground. Negative definitions might tell us
that something is the case, but a real definition tells us *why*.

Kant states a similar position in a reflection:

> Nominal definition is that which is sufficient to achieve cognition
> through comparison. Real definition is that which [is sufficient for]
> derivation. For example “The circle is a curved line, in which all
> similar parts touch one another” is a nominal [definition], for it
> does not allow for the derivation of characteristics from itself.
> Accordingly, it is not sufficient to give the object. This also
> includes merely negative definitions (e.g. concepts of the
> understanding are those which are not sensory). The definition “God is
> that absolutely necessary being” is nominal, insofar as I can cognize
> nothing but negative characteristics therefrom. (R2916, 16:575 (either
> 1764-8 or 1778-9))

Here it seems that a real (as opposed to nominal) definition
is one which has a certain kind of explanatory significance or
status—viz., it exhibits the ground of the possibility of a thing. Kant
emphasizes derivation, but not just any derivation will do, it must be
one which, in line with his notion of an antecedently determining
ground, which provides a derivation that is not only necessary but
explanatory. In the case of mathematics, Kant seems
to think that all the conditions necessary for providing real
definitions are satisfied. Mathematical concepts are elective and
constructed a priori.

> there remain no other concepts that are fit for being defined than
> those containing an elective [*willkürliche*] synthesis which can be
> constructed a priori, and thus only mathematics has definitions. For
> the object that it thinks it also exhibits [*stellt dar*] a priori in
> intuition, and this can surely contain neither more nor less than the
> concept, since through the explanation [*Erklärlung*] of the concept
> the object is originally given, i.e., without the explanation being
> derived from anywhere else. (A729-30/757-8)

Kant here indicates two important features of a mathematical
concept—viz. its a priori character and the ‘original’ [*ursprünglich*]
derivation of its object. I’ll take these two points in turn.

First, though both the empirical concept `<chronometer>` and the concept
`<triangle>` are elective, in that their constituent marks are
explicitly synthetically assembled or specified in the construction of
the concept (JL 9:141), only the geometric concept allows for this
specification a priori, via appeal to pure intuition.[^37] This is what
Kant calls a ‘genetic’ definition, in which the object of the concept so
defined can be “exhibited [*dargestellt*] *a priori in concreto*” (JL
9:144).[^38] All mathematical concepts have this feature—viz. the
ability to provide, coeval with the conceptual definition, an instance
in pure intuition of the kind of object specified by the concept.[^39]
Kant makes this clear in a 1789 letter to Reinhold,

> the definition, as always in geometry, is *at the same time* the
> construction of the concept. (C 11:42, 19 May, 1789)

Kant also explicitly connects construction, definition, and a
priori intuition in his reply to Eberhard.

> In the most general sense one can call construction all exhibition of
> a concept through the (spontaneous) production of a corresponding
> intuition. If it occurs through the mere imagination in accordance
> with an a priori concept, it is called pure construction. (These are
> the constructions which the mathematician must make use of in all his
> demonstrations.) (OD 8:192)

So one cannot possess a mathematical concept without being
able to generate a corresponding (pure) intuition of an object which
satisfies this concept.[^40] This is obviously different from the
empirical case, where the particular physical laws might be such that no
object could actually instantiate all of the properties specified by the
concept `<chronometer>`. In a Kantian phrase, we cannot know that the
properties specified in the concept are not ‘really repugnant’
(A264–5/B320–1<!-- TODO: more citations -->) until the object so
specified has been made.[^41]
<!-- NOTE: Say more about real repugnance here? --> So an important
difference between the mathematical and empirical case is that only the
mathematical case allows, independent of any experience, the
presentation of an object satisfying the relevant concept.

The difference between real and nominal definition is not, however, limited
solely to a priori presentation of objects which satisfy the real definitions.
There is a second and equally important difference—viz. the fact that real
definitions provide explanatory grounds for all of the other feature of the
object(s) designated via the conceptual definition.

Real definitions articulates those features of an object which are
fundamentally explanatory of all other features it may come to have. This was a
view common amongst early modern thinkers. For example Spinoza argues in his
*Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect* that our knowledge of the
metaphysical (i.e. ‘real’) possibility of a thing must proceed from a ‘true and
legitimate definition’ of it.[^42] He goes on to say that,

> The conception or definition of the thing must be such that all the
> properties of the thing, when regarded by itself and not in
> conjunction with other things, can be deduced from it, as can be seen
> in the case of this definition of a circle. For from it we clearly
> deduce that all the lines drawn from the centre to the circumference
> are equal.[^43]

Locke construes the explanatory significance of definition in
similar terms.

> The complex *Ideas* we have of Substances, are, as it has been shewn,
> certain Collections of simple *ldeas*, that have been observed or
> supposed constantly to exist together. But such a complex *Idea*
> cannot be the real Essence of any Substance; for then the Properties
> we discover in that Body would depend on that complex *Idea*, and be
> deducible from it, and their necessary connexion with it be known; as
> all Properties of a Triangle depend on, and as far as they are
> discoverable, are deducible from the complex *ldea* of three Lines,
> including a Space. (EHU II.xxxi.6; cf. III.xi.22).

Locke famously denied that such knowledge, which he considers properly
*scientific* knowledge, could be had in the case of the physical world. Only
mathematics and ethics allow for the kind of scientific knowledge provided in
the articulation of real definitions.[^44]

Kant seems to endorse precisely this view. In the Blomberg logic lecture
notes Kant explicitly differentiates nominal from real essence in terms
of derivation.

> The concept that water is a fluid element, without odor or taste, 14
> times lighter than quicksilver, etc., is the logical essence of
> water[;] for if I have mastered physical cognitions about something,
> then I think of all this as soon as I mention the word water. From

> real essence. (24:118)

This connection of real essence to an exhaustive derivation of
its properties is repeated in other places, both published and
unpublished. Unsurprisingly, it is typically in connection with a
discussion of mathematical concepts. For example in the reflection
previously cited above Kant distinguishes real from nominal definition
insofar as the former is

> that which [is sufficient for] derivation. For example “The circle is
> a curved line, in which all similar parts touch one another” is a

Kant here distinguishes the nominal definition of a circle
from a real definition in terms of absence of the proper derivation
relations—viz. the nominal definition allows us to distinguish a circle
from other kinds of geometric objects but it doesn’t explain why a
circle has the various features that it has, nor what those features
could be.[^45] We also see here again Kant’s insistence that a real
definition, like an antecedently determining ground, provide a
*positive* characterization of an object. In Kant’s preferred definition
of a circle, we see his emphasis on the importance of derivation rather
than mere recognition.

Kant’s point here is that from the basic concepts `<point>`,
and `<line>` you can characterize the essential nature of a circle, and
thus give a real definition of `<circle>`, without resorting to any to
notion such as `<curved>`. Even the constructive procedure, according to
which a circle is generates ‘by the movement of a straight line around a
fixed point’ is merely a ‘practical corollary’ of the definition (C
11:53).

Thus, Kant’s repeated statements that real definitions provide cognition
of something according to its inner determinations or its real essence
(JL 9:143; cf. LL 24:920; R2999, 16:609
(\~1770-1)<!-- TODO: other citations? -->) posit a requirement on real
definition that it articulate the basic features of a thing, which
determine all other possible features that it may have, and which allow
for logical *cum* conceptual derivation.

Kant’s ultimate position then appears to be largely in agreement with
that of Locke insofar as both consider real definitions to be not only
important for categorization but also for the explanation of an object’s
features. Both also seemingly agree that real definitions are possible
in mathematics but not in the case of empirical concepts, and thus not
for empirical science. For Kant, even for an elective empirical concept,
such as `<chronometer>`, no real definition can be provided because,
even allowing that the definition is fixed, we cannot deduce from it all
the features that a chronometer can possibly have because there must be
other factors in play, such as the actual laws of nature. Hence, even if
an empirical concept could be given a complete analysis, or in the case
of an electively constructed concept, a totally explicit articulation,
the content of the concept could never, according to Kant, sufficiently
explain the totality of features characteristic of the concept’s
objects. It could only provide a means of adequately distinguishing them
from other things.

Before we go on to look at some of the further details of Kant's view of
mathematical construction I want to summarize what I take to be the main
differences between philosophy and mathematics. 

First, mathematics *constructs* its concepts while philosophy must
analyze *given* concepts. This has corresponding ramifications for the
definitions that are possible for each area of inquiry. In mathematics,
the definitions by which concepts are constructed are *real*. They are
exhaustive, complete, and fixed. They also present the marks of
mathematical concepts in such a was as to make clear the explanatory
hierarchy within which those marks are situated. This allows a possessor
of the relevant concept to (i) articulate the features of the object
necessary for distinguishing it from all other things (or types of
things); (ii) properly appreciate how the properties of a
mathematical object are determined, including the dependence relations
between those properties. 

Philosophy, in contrast, can only *explicate* its concepts. This means
that any definition articulated in the course of a conceptual analysis
is always in principle incomplete and uncertain. Philosophical
explications at best deal in *nominal* definitions, which allow for the
classification of the concept's objects, but not for any significant
explanatory derivation. 

[^31]: This seems to be the consensus view. Cf. @beck1956, 184-5;
    @dunlop2012, 93-7; @heis2014. Moreover, the consensus has been that
    only *mathematical* concepts may be constructed in a fashion which
    admits of strict definition. Cf. @beck1956, 186; @dunlop2012, 96.
    Mathematical concepts possess this special status, it has been
    argued, because they are the only concepts which contain within
    themselves the a priori rules for construction (in pure intuition)
    of their instances. Cf. @beck1956, 186-7; @dunlop2012, 96-7;
    @heis2014, 6-7. More on this below.

[^32]: Here I prefer ‘elective’ rather than ‘arbitrary’ as a translation
    fo ‘*willkurlich*’, particularly because the electively assembled
    concept need not be assembled *at random*, as the use of ‘arbitrary’
    might suggest. Cf. @beck1956, 186-7; @meerbote1982, 78; @dunlop2012,
    note 28. Dunlop credits the idea of the choice of ‘elective’ in
    translation to Daniel Sutherland.

[^33]: @beck1956, 185-6 construes Kant’s meaning in this way. Beck goes
    on to say that “the devising of the object is proof that the concept
    has real objective possibility and is not chimerical.” So in
    actually inventing a chronometer (to use Kant’s example), one proves
    the possibility of the concept.

[^34]: @dunlop2012 explains the issue as one of demonstrating the
    “legitimacy of the concept’s use” by articulation of the definition;
    @dunlop2012, 96. But this seems open to the objection mentioned
    above. An engineer might well be able to assess the applicability of
    the concept `<chronometer>` even if neither she, nor anyone else,
    ever actually gets around to building one.

[^35]: This was not an uncommon view. Arnauld and Nicole express a
    similar view in their *Logic* (@arnauld1996, 25). Leibniz also seems
    to endorse this view (cf. the discussion in @adams1994, 109). Lewis
    White Beck (@beck1956, 183-4) seems to err here in his discussion of
    Kant’s views on definition. He argues that the difference between
    nominal and real definition ultimately comes down to derivability,
    and uses R2916, cited above, as his evidence. As the discussion here
    of negative marks and derivability makes clear, Kant’s distinction
    is not one about derivation but rather explanation.

    @carson1997; @dunlop2012; @heis2014 for discussion of the notion of
    pure intuition and its role in grounding a priori knowledge of
    mathematical objects.

[^38]: So all genetic definitions are real. It is possible however that
    Kant considers the possibility of real definitions that are not
    genetic. See R3000, R3002, 16:609.

[^39]: There is some ambiguity as to whether Kant thinks the possession
    condition of a mathematical concept, whose real definition we
    articulate, entails merely the correlated possession of a *capacity*
    for constructing the relevant object in pure intuition, or the
    *actual* construction of that object in intuition. For example,
    there is Kant’s (in)famous remark that “we cannot think a circle
    without describing it in thought” (B154), which seemingly requires
    that the mere *thought* of a circle entails a mental act of
    (visually?) rotating a line segment around a fixed point on a plane.
    Emily Carson distinguishes the capacity invovled in the possesion of
    the concept from the actual constructive act in pure intuition. See
    @carson1997, 505. @dunlop2012 and @heis2014 emphasize the importance
    of the capacity, which makes sense given their identification of
    concept possession in the mathematical case with the possession of
    the relevant *recognitional capacity* or *capacities*. But as we’ll
    see below, the importance of giving a real definition goes beyond
    that of grounding a recognitional capacity, as it also provides a
    particular kind of explanatory *derivability*.

[^40]: Cf. @dunlop2012, 112-13; @heis2014. It is an interesting question
    as to how exactly we should characterize the corresponding pure
    intuition. Kant explicitly denies that we should take his notion of
    construction in terms of e.g. compass and ruler constructions (OD
    8:192). On the issue of such ‘empirical’ constructions see
    @webb1987; @lachterman1989; @shabel1998, @shabel2003a. For an
    extremely interesting discussion of the dispute between Maimon and
    Kant on the relationship between mathematical construction,
    definition, and intuition see @freudenthal2006. Kant also explicitly
    denies that the significance of pure intuition in exhibiting the
    objects of mathematical concepts lies in the presentation of
    ‘images’ [*Bilder*]. See Kant’s response to Kästner, 20:412-13; cf.
    @onof2014a, 288; @kant2014, 306-7. I will say relatively little
    about this issue. But, as I emphasize below, the constructed objects
    of pure intuition have to be such that their essence, articulated by
    the real definition used in constructing them, grounds and explains
    their other properties in a manner befitting their status as
    antecedently determining grounds.

    Locke is contested; cf. @langton1998, 161 note; @langton2000.

[^45]: Cf. @beck1956, 184. The emphasis which Kant places on the
    presence, in real definition, of an explanatory ground from which
    other properties can be securely inferred is missed when we, with
    Dunlop and Heis, construe mathematical concepts primarily in terms
    of capacities to recognize particular kinds of spatial
    configurations. Such a recognitional capacity is already achieved in
    the articulation of a nominal definition of the geometric concept,
    and it isn’t enough to say (cf. @dunlop2012, ; @heis2014,
    <!-- TODO: provide
    citations! -->) that the capacity brings along with it knoweledge of
    the real possibility of its object, for this misses (or at least
    underemphasizes) the importance of the explanatory derivational
    relation between the definition, the concept, and the constructed
    object.

[^46]: Kant’s preferred definition is contrary to that of Wolff, who
    takes the real defintion to be articulated by the contruction
    procedure of rotating a line around a fixed point; see @wolff1740,
    143 (§191); @wolff1754, 148. Wolff takes Kant’s preferred definition
    to be merely nominal. Cf. @heis2014, 14. Heis takes this dispute
    between Wolff and Kant to indicate a difference in their views
    concerning what it is to grasp a concept (@heis2014, 15). According
    to Heis, Kant’s view of concept possession constitutively involves
    an ‘ability to do certain things’ (15), which in this case consists
    in the mental act of rotating a line around a fixed point. So,
    according to Heis, Kant’s definition and Wolff’s coincide in virtue
    of the fact that ‘to think of the points equidistant from a given
    point is *ipso facto* to think of a straight line moved around the
    given point’ (15), and thus the constructive ability presupposes the
    abilities requisite to think of a line. However, I believe this
    ‘pragmatic’ reading of Kant’s notion of concept possession lacks any
    support in the text. Kant’s criticism seems based on the fact that
    Wolff’s definition isn’t adequately explantorily basic, and
    introduces a derivative notion, `<curved>`, where it is unnecessary.

## Construction and Intuition ##

Mathematics, according to Kant, proceeds via the 'construction' of concepts.
Concepts are composed of marks (which are themselves concepts), so the most
basic sense of 'constructing a concept' entails putting together a series of
conceptual marks to make a complex concept. In the case of empirical concepts
such as `<linden tree>` Kant seems to think we generate the concept through a
complex series of mental acts involving comparison, reflection, and abstraction
(JL 9:94). So construction of an empirical concept requires a series of
empirical intuitions which are compared, similarities and differences noted,
and abstracted to form a concept which then classifies some set of things
accordingly.

Mathematical concepts, in contrast, are constructed a priori. This
means that no sensory experience is required, though Kant thinks that
*intuition*---viz. pure intuition---is nevertheless still necessary.
Here are what appear to be some fundamental characteristics of
mathematical construction:

1. A priori
2. The content of the concept is 'elective' [*willkürlich*]
3. The content of the concept is exhaustively defined
3. Construction proceeds via real definition
4. The concept provides a 'recipe' for generating a corresponding object in
   pure intuition
5. The pure intuition proves the objective validity of the concept (i.e. that
   its object is really possible)
6. The content of the concept distinguishes its object as being of a specific
   kind (e.g. as *round* or *square*)
7. The content of the concept *explains* why the object has the features that
   it does

Given that mathematics is an area in which we can give *real* as opposed
to merely *nominal* definitions, I take it that a mathematical concept
is constructed by means of a definition which is sufficent both to
(i) articulate the content of a distinct concept; (ii) provide the rule
or 'recipe' by which one can 'construct' a corresponding figure in pure
intuition. So the real definition both provides the concept and proves
that the concept has an object. In Kant's terms, this means that the
object is 'really possible' and that the concept has 'objective validity'.

There are, however, several questions that remain here, and do not have any
obvious answers. For example, one might be tempted to think that pure intuition
plays some evidentially decisive role in the articulation of mathematical
definitions, since, to use one of Kant's favored examples, from a passage in
the Postulates of Empirical Thought (A220-1/B268),

>It is, indeed, a necessary logical condition that a concept of the possible
>must not contain any contradiction; but this is not by any means sufficient to
>determine the objective reality of the concept, that is, the possibility of
>such an object as is thought through the concept. Thus there is no
>contradiction in the concept of a figure which is enclosed within two straight
>lines, since the concepts of two straight lines and of their coming together
>contain no negation of a figure. The impossibility arises not from the concept
>in itself, but in connection with its construction in space, that is, from the
>conditions of space and of its determination.

Pure intuition might be thought to offer decisive evidence against this
logical possibility, by making manifest that two straight lines cannot
really enclose a spatial expanse and form a plane figure. But this goes
against the model of construction offered above, because it assumes that
the construction in intuition is meant to verify (or exclude) the
concept rather than, as suggested above, be coeval with it according to
a given definition. 

The 'evidentialist' position is nearly correct. But it isn't that pure
intuition *itself* is evidence for the objective validity of the concept.
Rather, Kant's idea seems to be that specification of the concept 
`<two-sided plane figure>` does not yield a possible method of construction 
in pure intuition. There is no way to draw, visualize, or otherwise spatially
make manifest such a plane figure. So the conditions for real definition
haven't been satisfied and no positive mathematical cognition or knowledge is
provided.

The problem is that this notion of construction seems to rest on a (perhaps)
purely contingent psychological constraint --- viz. the failure to be able to
spatially imagine such a figure. But it isn't clear why such a failure
of imagination should be given such exalted epistemic significance.
