# Overview #

This paper further develops the 'anti-formalist' and 'phenomenological' reading
of Kant's philosophy of mathematics, as developed by Parsons, Brittan, and
Beck. Carson mostly develops the view as against Friedman's formalist reading.
She argues that (i) Friedman is wrong to interpret Kant as arguing that the
role of intuition in geometrical knowledge is purely logical, in that it allows
Kant to transcend the limitations of his monadic logic; (ii) construction in
pure intuition "exhibits the objective reality of geometrical concepts by
showing the possibility of an object corresponding to the concept" (502). Along
the way Carson argues that mathematical concepts must be given real definition
via appeal to construction in intuition in order for mathematical knowledge to
be possible (504, 507-8).
