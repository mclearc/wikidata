'Magnitude' in the modern period denotes both that which *has* a
magnitude and the *quantity* which the thing has. So the chairs in the
dining room are a discrete magnitude, having a magnitude of six units (
each unit being a chair), while the dinner table is a continuous
magnitude having a magnitude of 24 (with units being square feet).[^11128]
