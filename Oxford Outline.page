# Introduction #

- Articulate the textual puzzle
    + Kant explicitly denies that we can have knowledge of the real essence or
      inner determination of any thing
        * [JL 9:143-4](Quotes/Kant 9_143-4) 9:143-4; cf. A277/B333, Ref. 2995, 16:607, Ref 2999, 16:609
    + Kant repeatedly says in the MFNS that we have knowledge of the essence of
      `<matter>`
        * 4:511; cf. 500, 501, 508-9, 512, 514, 516, 543
- Outline aims of paper/talks
    + Kant's conception of physics as a proper science
        * Scholastic-Aristotelian conception of proper science
            - definition and essence in proper science
    + Easy resolution of textual problem isn't available
        * The MFNS cannot succeed if it only articulates the logical essence of
          `<matter>`
    + How Kant can both deny and affirm that we know the non-logical essence of
      `<matter>`

# The Scholastic-Aristotelian Conception of a Proper Science #

- Features of a proper science
    + apodictically certain
    + systematic
    + explains the derivative in terms of the fundamental
    
# Kant on Definition & Construction #

 - Explain the features that characterize definition in mathematics
 - Show how empirical concepts lack some but not all of these features
 - Question: are some features of definition more important than others?
   + Suggest that the central issue is one of explanation/explanatory ground
     not just demonstration of objective reality

# Definition & Essence in the MFNS #

- Problem set by Preface usually put in terms of the empirical vs. a priori
  status of `<matter>`
  + How can an empirical concept, whose objective validity is contingent, be at
    the basis of an apodictically certain a priori science?
  + This ignores the fact that simply substituting an a priori concept doesn't
    give Kant what he needs
    * Content of concept must be a priori certain---viz. demonstrable
    (apodeictic) 
    * Content must be non-trivial---viz. synthetic
    * Content must figure as *ground* of explanation rather than fact

## The Problem with `<matter>` ##

- `<matter>` is a *given* concept
  + no exhaustive analysis
    * textual problem with 4:472
  + content is not elective
- The objective validity of `<matter>` cannot(?) be established a priori
  + No a priori representation can establish the existence of anything
    * There is a big debate here concerning whether mathematics
    establishes the real possibility of its objects a priori, or
    whether that is done solely via experience. Cf. [friedman1992]() for a
    negative argument and also the discussion [here](Construction#friedman-construction).
      - I think [carson1997]() gets it right [by arguing
        that](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/carson1997.pdf?page=21)
        mathematics does establish the objective validity of its concepts a
        priori, but that this depends on the a priori proof of the
        applicability of the categories to the pure intuition of space, thus
        explaining the possibility of geometry in general.
      - I want to argue with Carson and Förster against Friedman that
        mathematical proof does include the a priori proof of the objective
        validity of its objects.
          + In contrast to Carson (I think), I want to claim that this
          is so in virtue of the metaphysical properties of space,
          which we have a priori knowedge or 'insight' [*Einsicht*]
          into.
