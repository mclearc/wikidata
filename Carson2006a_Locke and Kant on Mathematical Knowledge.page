# Locke on Mathematical Knowledge #

For Locke, mathematical knowledge is knowledge of ideas of modes (modes
of what?) and thus consists in,

>combinations of simple ideas which the mind puts together arbitrarily, of its
>own choice, without reference to any “real existence”, and subject only to
>the condition that the simple ideas be “consistent in the understanding”.
>Because they have their existence “in the thoughts of men” rather than “in the
>reality of things”, we can have perfect knowledge of them. On the other hand,
>ideas of substance, the subject matter of natural philosophy, purport to refer
>to things as they really exist, and to represent that constitution on which
>all their properties depend. Thus we can never be sure that we have captured
>all the various qualities belonging to the thing.[^125755]

\noindent Locke cashes this distinction out in terms of knowledge of
essence. To illustrate the difference, Locke compares the idea of triangle with
that of gold (cf. @carson2006a, 6):

>. . . a Figure including a Space between three Lines, is the real, as well as
>nominal *Essence* of a Triangle; it being not only the abstract *Idea* to
>which the general Name is annexed, but the very *Essentia*, or Being, of the
>thing itself, that Foundation from which all its Properties flow, and to which
>they are all inseparably annexed.

In the case of gold, however, the real essence is

>. . . the real Constitution of its insensible Parts, on which depend all those
>Prop- erties of Colour, Weight, Fusibility, Fixedness, etc. which are to be
>found in it. Which Constitution we know not; and so having no particular Idea
>of, have no Name that is the Sign of it. But yet it is its Colour, Weight,
>Fusibility, and Fixedness, etc. which makes it to be *Gold*, or gives it a
>right to that Name, which is therefore its nominal Essence [3.3.18].

\noindent So, as Carson concludes, we have here,

>the key difference between ideas of modes and of substances which explains why
>we have certain knowledge of the one, but not of the other. Because ideas of
>modes are combinations of ideas which the mind puts to- gether arbitrarily
>without reference to any real existence outside it, the real essence just is
>the nominal essence.[^125730]
