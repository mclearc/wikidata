Kant [argues](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/kant2004.pdf?page=46)
that the concept `<matter>` needs to be 'constructed' [*konstruiert*].
It isn't all that clear what this means. Kant speaks of 'constructing'
concepts in the mathematical case as well, and it is clear that here he
means to link `<matter>` with mathematics. 

>Now to cognize something a priori means to cognize it from its mere
>possibility. But the possibility of determinate natural things cannot be
>cognized from their mere concepts; for from these the possibility of the
>thought (that it does not contradict itself) can certainly be cognized, but
>not the possibility of the object, as a natural thing that can be given
>outside the thought (as existing). Hence, in order to cognize the possibility
>of determinate natural things, and thus to cognize them a priori, it is still
>required that the intuition corresponding to the concept be given a priori,
>that is, that the concept be constructed. Now rational cognition through
>construction of concepts is mathematical. Hence, although a pure philosophy of
>nature in general, that is, that which investigates only what constitutes the
>concept of a nature in general, may indeed be possible even without
>mathematics, a pure doctrine of nature concerning determinate natural things
>(doctrine of body or doctrine of soul) is only possible by means of
>mathematics. And, since in any doctrine of nature there is only as much proper
>science as there is a priori knowledge therein, a doctrine of nature will
>contain only as much proper science as there is mathematics capable of
>application there. (4:470)

But what is the significance of construction in the case of
`<matter>` and how is it related to mathematical construction? And more
basically, what is mathematical construction? In terms of the paper on
definition, I won't pursue these questions exhaustively, but I should
be sure to make clear the basic connection between the definition given
in mathematics, and mathematical construction generally, if I am to
make the necessary link between Kant's project for the pure part of
physics and real definition as carried out in mathematics.

# Definition in Mathematics #

Concepts are composed of marks, so the most basic sense of 'constructing a
concept' entails putting together a series of conceptual marks to make a
complex concept. In the case of empirical concepts such as `<linden tree>` Kant
seems to think we generate the concept through a complex series of mental acts
involving comparison, reflection, and abstraction (JL 9:94). So
construction of an empirical concept requires a series of empirical
intuitions which are compared, similarities and differences noted, and
abstracted to form a concept which then classifies some set of things
accordingly.

Mathematical concepts, in contrast, are constructed a priori. This
means that no sensory experience is required, though Kant thinks that
*intuition*---viz. pure intuition---is nevertheless still necessary.
Here are what appear to be some fundamental characteristics of
mathematical construction:

1. A priori
2. The content of the concept is elective [*willkürlich*]
3. The content of the concept is exhaustively defined
3. Construction proceeds via real definition
4. The concept provides a 'recipe' for generating a corresponding object in
   pure intuition
5. The pure intuition proves the objective validity of the concept (its real
   possiblity)
6. The content of the concept distinguishes its object as being of a specific
   kind (e.g. as *round* or *square*)
7. The content of the concept *explains* why the object has the features that
   it does

## Mathematical vs. Metaphysical Definition ##

Kant thinks that there are important differences between the
mathematical and philosophical spheres of inquiry such that the method
of mathematics cannot be easily transported to
philosophy---sepcifically, metaphysics. The difference centers on the
issue of definition. As Kant says in his 1763 Prize Essay,

>In mathematics I begin with the definition of my object, for example, of a
>triangle or a circle, or whatever. In metaphysics I may never begin with a
>definition. Far from being the first thing I know about the object, the
>definition is nearly always the last thing I come to know. In mathematics,
>namely, I have no concept of my object at all until it is furnished by the
>definition. In metaphysics I have a concept which is already given to me
>although it is a confused one. My task is to search for the distinct, complete
>and determinate concept. (2:283)

The concepts with which philosophy works are given to it.
Thus its definitions are arrived at analytically (2:276). In contrast, the
concepts with which mathematics works are *made*, and its concepts are
arrived at synthetically, as a result of the definition articulated.
For example, in the case of the concept `<cone>` Kant says that,

>[w]hatever the concept of cone may ordinarily signify, in mathematics the
>concept is the product of the arbitrary representation of a right-angled
>triangle which is rotated on one of its sides (2:276).[^133042]

[^133042]: Cf. @carson2006a, 10-11.

So mathematical knowledge, as Kant envisions it, does not proceed from concepts
concerning things we encounter in nature, but rather from definitions used to
construct concepts a priori.

Mathematical definition both exhaustively details the content of a
concept and provides a method for constructing its object. But the
concept itself does not prove the real possibility of its object. That
requires intuition. So in the case of philosophical analysis, the
problem isn't that the concept does not prove the real possibility of
its object, but rather that the definition which specifies the concept
(in this case, its logical essence) does not also give an a priori rule
or method for constructing the concept. We have to go and look for the
concept, and hence there is no apodeictic certainty built into the
concept, that its object is really possible. 

# Interpretations #

## Plaas 1966 ##

[plaass1966]() construes metaphysical construction in terms of 

## Förster 2000 ##

Here’s a telling passage from [forster2000]():

>The task of a construction of the concept ‘matter’ thus really has two sides
>to it. The *Metaphysical Foundations* must first take the empirical concept of
>matter in general and determine what a priori cognitions are possible with
>regard to it. That is, it must analyze this concept and discern the
>fundamental properties that belong to the possibility of matter in general
>(4:472). It must then, second, demonstrate how the concept ‘matter’ can be
>constructed from the elements thus gained. It must show, in other words, how
>to exhibit a priori the intuition that corresponds to the concept.
>(@forster2000, 62)

Förster argues that Kant *does* allow for the a priori construction of matter
in the MFNS, but denies that this construction allows us to derive the
characteristics of specific forms of matter because we lack a priori knowledge
of particular natural laws. So the nature of matter as fluid, rigid, brittle,
elastic, etc., is not something that can be derived from the a priori
construction of `<matter>` in terms of `<motion>`, and specifically, as
consisting of opposed forces of attraction and repulsion. Förster thus
argues that it doesn't really matter to Kant's project in the MFNS what
the specific law regarding repulsive force is, so long as it can be
shown that *whatever the content of the law*, it is consistent with the
conception of `<matter>` in terms of opposing forces.[^163348]

[^163348]: @forster2000, 65.

Förster also argues against [friedman1992]()'s interpretation that the
passage at 4:525 shows that Kant in fact *denies* the possibility of
constructing `<matter>`. Förster notes, rightly I think, that Kant
seems only to be denying the possibility of deriving all the specific
varieties of matter from the general concept. See also my discussion
of [Friedman](#friedman-construction) and his [1992](friedman1992) and
his more recent [2013](friedman2013).


## Friedman 1992 & 2013 ## {#friedman-construction}

Friedman argues that Kant is *not* attempting to give an a priori construction
of `<matter>`. @friedman2013 cites two reasons. First, that Kant denies in the
General Remark to the Dynamics chapter that a construction of `<matter>` is
possible given a dynamical conception of matter.[^173228] Second, that
the demonstration of the real possibililty of any concept requires
adverting to *experience* and cannot be accomplished a priori.[^174013] 

[^174013]: @friedman, 28-9.

[^173228]: @friedman2013, 28.

Friedman cites a variety of passages from the First Postulate
(A218-20/B265-67) and in particular one key passage.

>if one wanted to make entirely new concepts of substances, of forces, and of
>interactions from the material that perception offers us, without borrowing
>the example of their connection from experience itself, then one would end up
>with nothing but figments of the brain, for the possibility of which there
>would be no indications at all, since in their case one did not accept
>experience as instructress nor borrow these concepts from it. Invented
>concepts of this sort cannot acquire the character of their possibility a
>priori, like the categories, as conditions on which all experience depends,
>but only a posteriori, as ones given through experience itself, and their
>possibility must either be cognized a posteriori and empirically or not
>cognized at all. (A222/B269-70)

This statement of Friedman's position is also in line with his general
position regarding the relation between mathematical knowledge and
empirical intuition.[^174858]
