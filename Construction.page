Kant [argues](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/kant2004.pdf?page=46)
that the concept `<matter>` needs to be 'constructed' [*konstruiert*].
It isn't all that clear what this means. Kant speaks of 'constructing'
concepts in the mathematical case as well, and it is clear that here he
means to link `<matter>` with mathematics. 

>Now to cognize something a priori means to cognize it from its mere
>possibility. But the possibility of determinate natural things cannot be
>cognized from their mere concepts; for from these the possibility of the
>thought (that it does not contradict itself) can certainly be cognized, but
>not the possibility of the object, as a natural thing that can be given
>outside the thought (as existing). Hence, in order to cognize the possibility
>of determinate natural things, and thus to cognize them a priori, it is still
>required that the intuition corresponding to the concept be given a priori,
>that is, that the concept be constructed. Now rational cognition through
>construction of concepts is mathematical. Hence, although a pure philosophy of
>nature in general, that is, that which investigates only what constitutes the
>concept of a nature in general, may indeed be possible even without
>mathematics, a pure doctrine of nature concerning determinate natural things
>(doctrine of body or doctrine of soul) is only possible by means of
>mathematics. And, since in any doctrine of nature there is only as much proper
>science as there is a priori knowledge therein, a doctrine of nature will
>contain only as much proper science as there is mathematics capable of
>application there. (4:470)

\noindent But what is the significance of construction in the case of
`<matter>` and how is it related to mathematical construction? And more
basically, what is mathematical construction? In terms of the paper on
definition, I won't pursue these questions exhaustively, but I should
be sure to make clear the basic connection between the definition given
in mathematics, and mathematical construction generally, if I am to
make the necessary link between Kant's project for the pure part of
physics and real definition as carried out in mathematics.

# Definition in Mathematics #

Concepts are composed of marks, so the most basic sense of 'constructing a
concept' entails putting together a series of conceptual marks to make a
complex concept. In the case of empirical concepts such as `<linden tree>` Kant
seems to think we generate the concept through a complex series of mental acts
involving comparison, reflection, and abstraction (JL 9:94). So
construction of an empirical concept requires a series of empirical
intuitions which are compared, similarities and differences noted, and
abstracted to form a concept which then classifies some set of things
accordingly.

Mathematical concepts, in contrast, are constructed a priori. This
means that no sensory experience is required, though Kant thinks that
*intuition*---viz. pure intuition---is nevertheless still necessary.
Here are what appear to be some fundamental characteristics of
mathematical construction:

1. A priori
2. The content of the concept is elective [*willkürlich*]
3. The content of the concept is exhaustively defined
3. Construction proceeds via real definition
4. The concept provides a 'recipe' for generating a corresponding object in
   pure intuition
5. The pure intuition proves the objective validity of the concept (its real
   possiblity)
6. The content of the concept distinguishes its object as being of a specific
   kind (e.g. as *round* or *square*)
7. The content of the concept *explains* why the object has the features that
   it does

Here’s a telling passage from [Förster 2000]():

>The task of a construction of the concept ‘matter’ thus really has two sides
>to it. The *Metaphysical Foundations* must first take the empirical concept of
>matter in general and determine what a priori cognitions are possible with
>regard to it. That is, it must analyze this concept and discern the
>fundamental properties that belong to the possibility of matter in general
>(4:472). It must then, second, demonstrate how the concept ‘matter’ can be
>constructed from the elements thus gained. It must show, in other words, how
>to exhibit a priori the intuition that corresponds to the concept.
>(@forster2000, 62)

Neither in this passage, nor in what follows, does he ever raise the question
of how it might be that such an analysis and construction could be possible
(actually, he does discuss the issue of construction, but not in a way relevant
to the questions I’m raising). How could Kant hope to complete a project in
which he articulates the ‘fundamental properties that belong to the possibility
of matter in general’ when he denies that we could ever have knowledge of real
definitions, which are exactly the kind of thing which articulates the
fundamental features of the possibility of a thing!

Perhaps the reply here is one which brings in the project of the TD. Certainly,
that purports to show how an object must have a particular set of properties
(e.g. be a substance standing in causal community with other substances, etc.).
Isn’t the issue of the construction of `<matter>` just an more specific
application of this strategy, and in response to just a slightly more specific
version of the general question, how do subjective conditions of thinking
become objective conditions of reality?
