# Introduction, CPJ 5:183-4

>the universal laws of nature yield such an interconnection among things with respect to their genera, as things of nature in general, but not specifically, as such and such particular beings in nature, the power of judgment must thus assume it as an a priori principle for its own use that what is contingent for human insight in the particular (empirical) laws of nature nevertheless contains a lawful unity, not fathomable by us but still thinkable, in the combination of its manifold into one experience possible in itself. (CPJ 5:183-4)

This is significant because it shows that Kant thinks we have a priori insight into the nature of matter in general but not to specific configurations of matter; cf. MFNS General Remark to the Dynamics, 4:524-5 and discussion of
