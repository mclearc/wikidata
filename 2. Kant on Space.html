<h1 id="the-problem-with-space">The Problem with Space</h1>
<p>One of the major philosophical disputes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries concerned the issue of space. What is space? By the mid-eighteenth century there were two major competing positions. On the one hand, following Newton, many philosophers and scientists construed space as a kind of <em>subsisting entity</em>. On this view space (and correspondingly time) exists independently of any possible <em>objects</em> that may occupy space, and independently of any possible <em>relations</em> between such space-occupying objects. Space is, on this view, a kind of container in which objects are placed. Spatial relations (e.g. position, relative motion) are determined by the relations which objects have to this container space, and the relations of this spaces (or spatial regions) to one another. Call this the ‘<em>absolute</em>’ conception of space.</p>
<p>In contrast to the conception of space as absolute, Leibniz proposed that space is merely a set of relations that hold between independently specifiable objects. This ‘<em>relationalist</em>’ conception of space says that space is <em>not</em> something that exists over and above the objects which occupy it. It is merely the order of possible relations between distinct existing substances. So while we could, on the relationalist view, conceive of empty space, insofar as we conceive of the possible relations which substances might enter into, space could not exist as something independent of any such possible objects.</p>
<p>In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> Kant argues against <em>both</em> of these theories of the metaphysics of space. His suggestion is that space is neither a subsisting entity nor a set of relations, but rather a product of our subjective apprehension of objects that are distinct from us. It is, in his phrase, a ‘form of intuition’.</p>
<h2 id="the-metaphysical-exposition-of-space">The Metaphysical Exposition of Space</h2>
<p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-spacetime">Kant’s arguments</a> concerning the nature of space and the nature of our representation of it occur in the ‘Metaphysical Exposition’ of the first <em>Critique</em>. Kant makes four arguments here, which raise a variety of questions concerning their proper interpretation. Part of the complexity of interpretation is due to the complex nature of Kant’s arguments. He is trying to do several things simultaneously. First, he is intervening in a debate concerning the ontological status of space—is it a subsisting thing (absolutism) or is it an order of relations (relationalism)? Second, he is concerned with answering the question as to the origin of our representation of space. Space is different from the objects that are in it. So where does this representation come from? Third, Kant is concerned with the content or nature of the representation of space. Is it a fundamentally intellectual (conceptual) kind of representation?</p>
<p>Kant’s first two arguments (EMT 29) run as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is not an empirical concept that has been drawn from experiences. For in order for certain sensations to be related to some thing outside me (i.e., to something in another place in space from that in which I find myself), thus in order for me to represent them as outside <and
next to> one another, thus not merely as different but as in different places, the representation of space must already be their ground. Thus the representation of space cannot be obtained from the relations of outer appearance through experience, but this outer experience is itself first possible only through this representation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is a necessary representation, <em>a priori</em>, that is the ground of all outer intuitions. One can never represent that there is no space, though one can very well think that there are no objects to be encountered in it. It is therefore to be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances, not as a determination dependent on them, and is an <em>a priori</em> representation that necessarily grounds outer appearances.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a variety of possible targets for these arguments, but one target seems clear—viz. the claim that the representation of space is drawn from the content of our experience. This is particularly clear from the first argument, as Kant seems to be denying the Lockean claim (<em>Essay</em>, II.xiii.2-4) that the representation of space is derived from the representation of the distances between objects. Kant’s point (or a point) in the first argument is that we cannot represent one object as <em>distant</em> from another without already representing them as being in one space in which they may be related. Kant’s second argument is perhaps less persuasive, for it argues that we cannot represent a lack of space. Certainly, this fact would seem to go against the empiricist view of space as something we learn from experience. But it seems that the empiricist might counter that once the representation of space is gained via experience, we cannot part with it psychologically, and so cannot represent its absence.</p>
<p>Thus, with these first two arguments Kant attempts to refute a particular position concerning the <em>source</em> of our representation of space—viz. experience. The representation of space is not to be found in the content of our experience, rather, outer experience presupposes that its content will consist of spatially related items. Spatial representation is thus presupposed by our having any representation of anything distinct from ourselves or other things at all. Thus, if the first two arguments are correct, the representation of space is a priori and not empirical.</p>
<p>Kant’s third and fourth arguments run as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is not a discursive or, as we say, universal concept of things as such; rather, it is a pure intuition. For, first, we can represent only one space; and when we speak of many spaces, we mean by that only parts of one and the same unique space. Nor, second, can these parts precede the one all-encompassing space, as its constituents, as it were (from which it can be assembled); rather, they can be thought only as in it. Space is essentially one; the manifold in it, and hence also the universal concept of spaces as such, rests solely on [our bringing in] limitations. It follows from this that, as far as space is concerned, an <em>a priori</em> intuition of it (i.e., one that is not empirical) underlies all concepts of space. (A24-5/B39).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is represented as an infinite given magnitude. Now it is true that every concept must be thought as a representation that is contained in an infinite multitude of different possible representations (as their common characteristic) and hence the concept contains these representations under itself. But no concept, as such, can be thought as containing an infinite multitude of representations within itself. Yet that is how we think space (for all parts of space, <em>ad infinitum</em>, are simultaneous). Therefore the original representation of space is an <em>a priori</em> intuition, not a concept (B39-40).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Kant’s aim (or one aim) in the third and fourth arguments is to deny a particular view concerning the content or nature of the representation of space. Spatial representation is not fundamentally intellectual or conceptual, but rather ‘intuitive’. This is not to say that spatial representation is <em>sensory</em>. We do not have a sensory representation of an infinite space! Kant is trying to carve out room for a position according to which we have a non-sensory but non-conceptual representation of an infinite space, which makes possible our representation of particular spatial expanses. There are similarities here between Kant’s argument and previous rationalist arguments concerning the priority of the infinite over the finite. Kant’s third argument above is that the single infinite expanse of space is prior to, in the sense of being presupposed by, the existence of any particular spatial region. Kant’s fourth argument reinforces this by arguing that <em>if</em> spatial representation were conceptual (on Kant’s understanding of conceptual representation) then we would have to represent an infinite number of spaces or spatial regions. This would present us with an infinite task, which we would obviously be unable to accomplish. Since Kant thinks we clearly do represent space as an infinite expanse, we must be doing so <em>non-conceptually</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ideality-of-space">The Ideality of Space</h2>
<p>Thus far Kant has made arguments for two of our three topics. He’s argued that the source of our representation is not empirical, and thus that the representation of space is a priori. He has also argued that the nature or ‘content’ of the representation is intuitive rather than conceptual. But what about the ontology of space? Is space a subsisting thing, capable of existince independent of any and all objects or their relations(absolutism)? Or is it merely the set of possible relations which objects may stand in (relationalism)?</p>
<p>After Kant gives the arguments discussed above he draws two surprising conclusions. First, he argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Space represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor any relation of them to each other, i.e., no determination of them that attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one were to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition. For neither absolute nor relative determinations can be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which they pertain, thus be intuited <em>a priori</em>. (A26/B42)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is surprising because, from what Kant has said in the above arguments, he has only been discussing our <em>representation</em> of space. But here he makes a claim concerning the <em>metaphysical status</em> of space—viz. that it is nothing ‘in itself’. He then goes on to explain what space actually is.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Space is nothing other than merely the form of all appearances of outer sense, i.e., the subjective condition of sensibility, under which alone outer intuition is possible for us. Now since the receptivity of the subject to be affected by objects necessarily precedes all intuitions of these objects, it can be understood how the form of all appearances can be given in the mind prior to all actual perceptions, thus <em>a priori</em>, and how as a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, it can contain principles of their relations prior to all experience. (A26/B42)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, according to Kant, space is nothing in itself but rather only a representation—viz. the form by which we represent distinct objects. How does he get to this conclusion?</p>
<p>First, Kant rejects a presupposition he thinks both the absolutist and the relationalist about space hold in common—viz. that space is something independent of the mind in general and our perception (or intuition) in particular.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In Kant’s terminology space is <em>ideal</em> in virtue of being mind-dependent. Kant makes this point clearer later in the <em>Critique</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand by the <strong>transcendental idealism</strong> of all appearances the doctrine that they are all together to be regarded as mere representations and not as things in themselves, and accordingly that space and time are only sensible forms of our intuition, but not determinations given for themselves or conditions of objects as things in themselves. To this idealism is opposed <strong>transcendental realism</strong>, which regards space and time as something given in themselves (independent of our sensibility). The transcendental realist therefore represents outer appearances (if their reality is conceded) as things in themselves, which would exist independently of us and our sensibility and thus would also be outside us according to pure concepts of the understanding. (A369)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This perhaps makes clearer why Kant thought he was making a move with respect to the debate between absolutists and relationalists about space—both positions assume that space is ‘transcendentally real’. But why think that space is ‘transcendentally ideal’ in the first place? What licenses the move from a claim about space as an a priori intuitive representation to the claim that space is <em>only</em> the form of outer intuition?</p>
<p>According to Kant, intuition is an ‘immediate’ and ‘singular’ awareness of an object. This contrasts with the conceptual representation of an object, which is ‘mediate’ and ‘general’. The role of intuition, Kant says, is to present us with objects, while concepts allow for thought of such objects (EMT 28). Kant’s argument for the ideality of space proceeds from this definition of intuition (cf. <span class="citation">Allais (2010)</span>)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Intuition necessarily involves the presentation of an object</li>
<li>We have an a priori intuition of space (and time)</li>
<li>A priori intuition cannot, by definition, involve the presence of an actual object</li>
<li><span class="math">∴ </span> Space is nothing other than a ‘pure’ a priori intuition</li>
</ol>
<p>Kant’s thinking here is that the role of intuition is to present its subject with an object. Intuition is what makes the difference between merely thinking or daydreaming about something and actually having it <em>present</em> to one. But, if this is right then there cannot be some <em>actual</em> thing which is present to one in an a priori intuition, since the definition of the a priori requires that the intuition be independent of experience and thus of any actual object.</p>
<p>Thus, (1) follows from Kant’s definition of intuition. (2) follows from the arguments of the Metaphysical exposition concerning the a priority and intuitive status of our representation of space. (3) is the crucial premise, but this seems to follow from the fact that an intuition must present something, and that something, in the absence of any experience, cannot be an actual object, but merely a feature of the mind itself. This gets us (4), that space is nothing other than a form of mental representation and not something subsisting in itself, or an order of possible relations between objects, independent of the mind.</p>
<h2 id="incongruent-counterparts">Incongruent Counterparts</h2>
<p>In §13 of the <em>Prolegomena</em>, which was a sort of summary version of the argument of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, intended to introduce Kant’s readers to the main themes of that work, Kant makes an argument concerning what he calls ‘incongruent counterparts’, perfectly similar objects that are mirror images of each other, such as left and right hands. This argument, he thinks, shows us that space cannot be mind-independent, but must be an intuition.</p>
<p>Kant was highly enamored of this argument. He used it first in 1768, to argue that space was Newtonian (absolute) rather than Leibnizian (relational). In 1770, he used the argument for a different conclusion, that our knowledge of space is via intuitive not conceptual representation. The <em>Prolegomena</em> argument of 1783 is for a still different conclusion, that space is ideal. So what exactly is the argument and how could it serve all these conclusions?</p>
<p>Let’s look briefly at the first two uses of the argument (cf. <span class="citation">Van Cleve (1991a)</span>; <span class="citation">Van Cleve (1991b)</span>). Kant’s argument against the Leibnizian relationalist position hinges on the fact that according to the Leibnizian relationalist, all spatial relations are a function of the intrinsic features of the relevant objects. So any change in spatial features is due to some change in the intrinsic, non-relational features of the object. In brief, Kant’s 1698 argument against Leibnizian relationalism says that incongruent counterparts like left and right hands are intrinsically exactly similar. This means that their orientation in space cannot be due to their ‘internal’ intrinsic, non-relational features, but must rather be due to something else—viz. their relation to some absolute space which contains them.</p>
<p>Kant’s 1770 argument takes up this point and applies it to our representation of space. If, Kant argues, our representation of space were ultimately purely conceptual (as the Leibnizian argues), then we should be able, by means of concepts alone, to distinguish incongruent counterparts. But, he argues, conceptual representation of (e.g.) a left and a right hand will not differ since such counterparts do not differ (let us suppose) in any qualitatively intrinsic way (e.g. neither figure nor internal angles would differ), nor in any quantitative way (they differ not according to size, etc.). So since there is no intrinsic difference between the two hands, there is nothing conceptually to distinguish one as the left and the other as the right. We must represent their difference by some other means, which Kant argue is by means of intuition.</p>
<p>The <em>Prolegomena</em>’s conclusion that consideration of incongruent counterparts demonstrates that space is ideal is deeply contested. The conclusion is not the only thing that is contested, unfortunately, for it is not at all clear how the argument goes. The passage (EMT 19-20) is below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If two things are fully the same (in all determinations belonging to magnitude and quality) in all the parts of each that can always be cognized by itself alone, it should indeed then follow that one, in all cases and respects, can be put in the place of the other, without this exchange causing the least recognizable difference. In fact this is how things stand with plane figures in geometry; yet various spherical figures, notwithstanding this sort of complete inner agreement, nonetheless reveal such a difference in outer relation that one cannot in any case be put in the place of the other; e.g., two spherical triangles from each of the hemispheres, which have an arc of the equator for a common base, can be fully equal with respect to their sides as well as their angles, so that nothing will be found in either, when it is fully described by itself, that is not also in the description of the other, and still one cannot be put in the place of the other (that is, in the opposite hemisphere); and here is then after all an <em>inner</em> difference between the triangles that no understanding can specify as inner, and that reveals itself only through the outer relation in space…What indeed can be more similar to, and in all parts more equal to, my hand or my ear than its image in the mirror? And yet I cannot put such a hand as is seen in the mirror in the place of its original; for if the one was a right hand, then the other in the mirror is a left, and the image of the right ear is a left one, which can never take the place of the former. Now there are no inner differences here that any understanding could merely think; and yet the differences are inner as far as the senses teach, for the left hand cannot, after all, be enclosed within the same boundaries as the right (they cannot be made congruent), despite all reciprocal equality and similarity; one hand’s glove cannot be used on the other. What then is the solution? These objects are surely not representations of things as they are in themselves, and as the pure understanding would cognize them, rather, they are sensory intuitions, i.e., appearances, whose possibility rests on the relation of certain things, unknown in themselves, to something else, namely our sensibility. Now, space is the form of outer intuition of this sensibility, and the inner determination of any space is possible only through the determination of the outer relation to the whole space of which the space is a part (the relation to outer sense); that is, the part is possible only through the whole, which never occurs with things in themselves as objects of the understanding alone, but does occur with mere appearances. We can therefore make the difference between similar and equal but nonetheless incongruent things (e.g., oppositely spiralled snails) intelligible through no concept alone, but only through the relation to right-hand and left-hand, which refers immediately to intuition. (Pr §13, 37-8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One possible reading of the argument (cf. <span class="citation">Van Cleve (1999)</span>, ch. 2) goes as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Incongruent counterparts are different in virtue of their differing relations to space as a whole.</li>
<li>All relations among things in themselves are reducible to the nonrelational qualities of the relata.</li>
<li>Therefore, if space and figures within it are things in themselves, one incongruent counterpart must differ internally from the other.</li>
<li>But, in fact, the counterparts do not differ internally.</li>
<li>Therefore, space itself and incongruent counterpart figures within it are not things in themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to this interpretation of Kant’s argument, Kant’s key move is with premise (2), which we might call the ‘reducibility premise’. The idea here is that, according to many philosophers with whose views Kant was engaged (such as Leibniz), differences between distinct objects (or substances) were supposed to be grounded in differences between the intrinsic features of those substances. Here we see a connection to Kant’s 1698 argument. The Reducibility premise requires that spatial differences like left-handedness ground out in intrinsic differences between left and right hands. But there are no such differences (and the same goes for other kinds of incongruent counterparts) so space and the things in it must not be things in themselves, or more simply, they must not be real mind-independent things.</p>
<p>This argument may be successful, or at least valid. But there are worries. First, premise (2) is not explicitly stated in the Kant’s text. Second, we need not appeal to space as a whole in the argument. All we need is that the ‘handedness’ of the incongruent counterparts need not reduce to their internal features, whatever their relation to space as a whole. Second, it is not even necessary to point to <em>incongruent</em> counterparts. Such elements of the argument are wholly dispensable. All the argument needs is for there to be some set of relations that are not reducible to their relata. There are many spatial relations, such as distance, which do not seem to so reduce. So why did Kant focus on incongruent counterparts then?</p>
<p>It’s obvious that Kant put great stock in the argument from incongruent counterparts, and used it to push a variety of different conclusions. Unfortunately it is not obvious exactly what the argument is supposed to be, nor how the fact of such incongruent counterparts could entail three such different conclusions.</p>
