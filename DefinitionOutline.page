# Kant on the Mathematical Method

Kant notoriously denies that the mathematical method is of use to
philosophy (citation?). Why?

## Definition

What is Kant’s theory of definition? Does it apply only to mathematical
objects or can we give definitions of physical objects as well?

### Nominal Definition

A distinct concept that “suffices for differentiation of a thing from
others” (24:919-20)

#### Nominal Definition and Knowledge

-   At JL §106 (9:143-4) Kant claims that nominal definitions either
    specify the logical essence of a thing or articulate the marks
    sufficient for distinguishing/differentiating that thing from
    others. This is not sufficient to think of nominal definition in
    terms of analytic truth (which I’ve been tempted to do).
-   Could nominal definitions be used in a proper science? No – they
    don’t provide the needed explanations (see “Essence and Proper
    Science”)

### Real Definition

A distinct concept that “suffices for cognizing and deriving everything
that belongs to the thing” (24:919-20; cf. 9:143-4)

### Definition & Essence

What is the connection for Kant between the definition of a thing and
its essence? Why is knowledge of the essence of a thing important for
Science?

#### Essence and Proper Science

A plausible explanation for the importance of essences to proper science
is that such a science requires explanations from grounds and only real
definitions offer the requisite grounds for explanation. Nominal
definitions cannot provide the requisite explanations both because they
are open to revision and because they cannot give logical derivations
that - and this seems to be the important point - explain why the
conclusion follows from the premises. They can at best be the basis of
valid arguments where the conclusion does so follow.

# Locke on Definition

What is Locke’s theory of definition? Does it extend beyond mathematical
objects?

## Real Essence/Definition

The real essence of a thing is that which makes the the thing what it
is, and from which all of its other characteristics flow (or may be
logically derived). In other words, there are necessary connections
between the real essence and the other characteristics of the thing in
question (perhaps excluding its accidents) and the real essence
*explains* the presence of these other characteristics.

> Essence may be taken for the being of any thing, whereby it is what it
> is. And thus the real internal, but generally in Substances, unknown
> Constitution of Things, whereon their discoverable Qualities depend,
> may be called their Essence. This is the proper original signification
> of the Word, as is evident from the formation of it; *Essentia*, in
> its primary notation signifying properly *Being*. And in this sense it
> is still used, when we speak of the *Essence* of particular things,
> without giving them any Name. (E III.iii.15, p. 417)

### Real essence and scientia

“What would be required for scientia in natural philosophy? Since
scientia generally concerns real essences, and since natural philosophy
for Locke concerns material substances and their powers, scientia in
natural philosophy would be knowledge of material substances’ real
essences and their necessary connections to qualities flowing from
them.” (@kochiras2013, 11)

Knowledge of real essence would thus allow us to deduce a thing’s
qualities without recourse to experience or experiment.

> Had we such Ideas of Substances, as to know what real Constitutions
> produce those sensible Qualities we find in them, and how those
> Qualities flowed from thence, we could, by the specifick *Ideas* of
> their real Essences in our own Minds, more certainly find out their
> Properties, and discover what Qualities they had, or had not, than we
> can now by our Senses: and to know the Properties of *Gold*, it would
> be no more necessary, that *Gold* should exist, and that we should
> make Experiments upon it, than it is necessary for the knowing the
> Properties of a Triangle, that a Triangle should exist in any Matter,
> the *Idea* in our Minds would serve for the one, as well as the other.
> (E IV.vi.11, p. 585)

#### Kant and Locke on natural science

Note that given Locke’s position regarding the role real essence plays
in natural science, it seems pretty clear that Kant’s articulation of
the structure of matter in the MFNS conforms to Locke’s conditions for
scientia.

### Essence and mechanism

There is extensive debate (see x-bdsk://kocrehiras2013) as to whether
Locke endorses “pure mechanism”, and thus construes all qualities of
matter as flowing from its real essence, understood in purely
corpuscularian terms. The debate hinges around the apparent
inconsistency between “Locke’s seeming acceptance of the corpuscular
hypothesis, most notable in his apparent identification of a material
substance’s real essence with the size, shape, and texture of its
insensible parts, and his pessimism about the hypothesis’ explanatory
power” (kochiras2013, 30), where issues concerning explanatory power
often involve the question of sensation or other mental properties that
God might superadd to matter.

### Pessimism about knowledge of real essence

Regardless of the debate concerning Locke’s position regarding real
essence and the corpuscularian hypothesis, it seems that he successfully
expressed skepticism concerning our knowledge of such essences,
skepticism that reached Germany (as found, e.g. in Herz’s *Betrachtungen
aus der Spekulativen Weltweisheit*).

#### Sensitive knowledge

Sensitive knowledge is what we have instead of proper scientific
knowledge. Instead of the causal ground or basis of the properties
perceived, we know only the effects of these grounds — viz., the
perceived properties. And the fact that properties are found to
regularly co-exist in observed cases does not tell us with any certainty
that those properties will be found to co-exist in the next case.

> For all the Qualities that are *co-existent* in any Subject, without
> this dependence and evident connexion of their *Ideas* one with
> another, we cannot know certainly any two to *co-exist* any farther,
> than Experience, by our Senses, informs us. Thus though we see the
> yellow Colour, and upon trial find the Weight, Malleableness,
> Fusibility, and Fixedness, that are united in a piece of Gold; yet
> because no one of these *Ideas* has any evident *dependence*, or
> necessary connexion with the other, we cannot certainly know, that
> where any four of these are, the fifth will be there also, how highly
> probable soever it may be. (E IV.iii.14, p. 546)

Yet our discoveries about co-existences of properties—though they are
merely contingent particulars, or, insofar as they are applied beyond
the particular cases we have actually observed, are mere probability—can
yet qualify as real knowledge. (@kochiras2013, 16)

(1) Criteria of sensitive knowledge

These are described in kochiras2013. I don’t find the discusses
especially compelling.

(a) Co-existence in nature

The complex ideas of substances that are the subject matter of the
science must consist all and only of simple ideas which are found to
coexist in nature.

> Herein therefore is founded the reality of our Knowledge concerning
> Substances, that all our complex Ideas of them must be such, and such
> only, as are made up of such simple ones, as have been discovered to
> co-exist in Nature. And our Ideas being thus true, though not,
> perhaps, very exact Copies, are yet the Subjects of real (as far as we
> have any) Knowledge of them. (E IV.iv.12, p. 568)

(b) General claims

”whatever have once had an union in Nature, may be united again.“ (E
IV.iv.12, p. 568)

I don’t see how this would be enough to justify moving from particular
to general, especially given the admittance that there is no necessary
connection between observed sensible properties.

#### Herz and Locke

Overtly Lockean worries are raised by Kant’s student Marcus Herz in the
latter’s 1771 commentary on Kant’sDissertation. Herz says,“I believe,
however, that I can maintain with great persuasiveness that there exists
much too great a distance between the relations of things as we
determine them in accordance with the laws of pure reason and what is
true of these things independently from our cognition. I base this on
nothing less than the nature of our cognition in general. Locke shows
that it extends never further than to the qualities which these things
have. Every part of our cognition is a judgment, in which we attribute
some determination of predicates to a thing as subject. But what
constitutes the substrate, on which all these qualities rest, cannot in
and of itself be again a quality, because otherwise a subject must again
be posited in which it [the quality] inheres. Instead it must be that we
can only intuit qualities and can never cognize a subject through
judgment” (Herz 1771/1990, p. 64).

## Nominal Essence/Definition

According to Kochiras, Locke understands nominal essence as “the set of
observable qualities we use to classify a thing (which implies that the
nominal essence could vary across time or communities)” (@kochiras2013,
9).

# The role of definition in MFNS

Kant aims to provide a ‘construction’ of the concepts that constitute
the concept `<matter>` which means that we need to (i) give a complete
analysis of `<matter>` (cf. x-bdsk://watkins2009a, 10) and (ii) codify the
boundaries of this analysis so that the concept’s structure isn’t open
to future revision. Satisfaction of these two criteria is necessary if
`<matter>` is to play its fundamental role in grounding physical knowledge
apodictically.

## The problem with definition in MFNS

There are several prima facie problems with the strategy just outlined.

i . Kant is explicit that empirical concepts cannot be defined, in part
because they cannot be exhaustively analyzed and their boundaries
definitively set (A727/B755).

ii. Mathematical construction of a concept entails articulating a real
    definition of the thing, and thus specifying its real essence. But
    Kant denies the possibility of knowledge of the real essence of any
    empirical object (JL §106 9:143-4; cf. A277/B333, Ref. 2995, 16:607,
    Ref 2999, 16:609) — see
    evernote:///view/1364029/s12/9fe57f3a-e62f-4f05-bd50-48125ebcc166/9fe57f3a-e62f-4f05-bd50-48125ebcc166/

### The aims of the paper

First, can we give an account of the strategy in MFNS such that it
resolves the two issues raised above?

Second, does the strategy Kant pursues in MFNS tell us anything more
broadly about the critical philosophy and its aims? Perhaps, that it may
profitably be understood as carving out, contra Locke, a form of
scientia for the empirical world, while nevertheless retaining some of
Locke’s humility?

# The Standard Problematic of MFNS

## What is a special metaphysics?

what particular natures or kinds of things could be its object? And how
precisely can an empirical concept of such things be given without
compromising the necessity required of the pure part of natural science?
(@watkins2009a)

## The Argumentative structure of MFNS

how is the special metaphysics provided by the Metaphysical Foundations
supposed to be related to the transcendental part of the metaphysics of
nature that was established in the Critique of Pure Reason? Does the
former presuppose the principles of the latter or are they logically
independent, but still related to each other in some other way?

### The “Standard View”

### The “Transcendental Deduction” View

## The status of `<matter>` as empirical

Here’s how Eric Watkins put the problem to me: “the issue is a difficult
one that no one really has a satisfying resolution of. People come at it
in different ways, but the basic problem is that the empirical concept
of matter is empirical (and hence might not be instantiated), but Kant
places the empirical concept of matter at the foundation of an a priori
science of nature which seems to be established with certainty (and a
priori). This sounds inconsistent, or is at least so problematic as to
require some kind of explanation. (One can put the problem as you do, in
terms of a distinction between explication and real definition, or in
other ways, but these are then different aspects of what I take to be
one fundamental problem.)”

Here’s how he puts it in @watkins2009a: “If the concept of matter, most
fundamentally, is simply the concept of any object of outer sense, then
how is it still empirical in any genuine sense (and what has become of
the structural difference Kant draws between the Critique of Pure Reason
and the Metaphysical Foundations)? If, by contrast, impenetrability,
extension, and movability are deemed the basic traits of the concept of
matter, then how can one know a priori that any object we might
encounter in outer sense must behave in accordance with the laws that
would govern matter so defined?”

### Strategies for resolving the role of `<matter>` in MFNS

#### Plaass (1965) x-bdsk://plaass1994

Plaass argues that the concept `<matter>` is empirical only in the sense
that proof of the objective reality of the concept depends on
experience. All other aspects of the concept, including its content (at
least insofar as it is articulated in MFNS) is a priori. So the MFNS
articulates the necessary and universal characteristics of matter *as
such*, as well as the laws which govern it (presumably the laws as
articulated by the Principles of *KrV*). matter considered only insofar
as it can be an object ofthe external senses at all and nothing more
specific. No properties of particular kinds of matter (particular
objects of the senses) and/or particular content of the concept are to
be taken into account that can be known only a posteriori. (cf.
@plaass1994, 29)

#### Hoppe (1969) x-bdsk://hoppe1969

#### Gloy (1976) x-bdsk://gloy1976

#### Brittan (1978) x-bdsk://brittan1978

#### Cramer (1985) x-bdsk://cramer1985

#### Buchdahl (1969, 1986) x-bdsk://buchdahl1969 x-bdsk://buchdahl1986

#### Friedman (1992, 2001, 2002) x-bdsk://friedman1992 x-bdsk://friedman2001a

#### Falkenburg (2000) x-bdsk://falkenburg2000

#### Pollok (2001) x-bdsk://pollok2001; x-bdsk://pollok2006

Pollok argues that the concept `<matter>` cannot be empirical because
“Experience cannot show that matter must be movable and that immovable
material cannot exist.” (@pollok2006, 570). So the concept is
articulated in a way other than that typical of empirical concepts (i.e
via comparison, reflection, and abstraction), viz., “only the objective
reality of the concept—“that such objects do exist” (10:285)—is actually
observed; its content is demonstrated in “a complete analysis of the
concept of a matter in general” (MFNS, 4724–5): the very task Kant
undertakes in the Metaphysical Foundations.” (ibid)

(1) Pollok’s Posiiton

Pollok thus seems to take a position similar to Watkins (and perhaps
Plaass) in that the main sense in which `<matter>` is empirical is the
sense in which we need experience to demonstrate the objective validity
of the concept: “Unlike transcendental a priori concepts, their
[i.e. empirical concepts] objective reality cannot be demonstrated by
referring to the conditions of possibility of objects of experience in
general. While the content of the concept of motion can be constructed a
priori (MFNS, 490~7~–495~26~), its reality presupposes the perception of
something movable (MFNS, 4827–13), a material substance whose concept is
itself determined by that of motion, or, more precisely, that of force
or dynamical resistance.” (@pollok2006, 570).

(2) Pollok’s Criticisms

Pollok importantly criticizes Hoppe, Walker, and Dahlstrom for
misunderstanding the strategy outlined in ¶15 of the Preface to
MFNS—viz., that the ‘ground determination of something as an object of
outer sense’ must be motion. Hoppe, Walker, and Dahlstrom all take the
content as well as the instantiation [of the concept <motion> and thus
`<matter>` as empirical, in the sense that they are’ dependent upon
experience, specifically upon the contingent makeup of human
sensibility’ (@pollok2006, 571) then they cannot account for how Kant
could take the MFNS as a pure doctrine of motion or a pure part of
natural science.

#### Watkins (1994, 1998) x-bdsk://watkins1994 x-bdsk://watkins1998a

The content of `<matter>` is determined and justified via a transcendental
argument concerning the conditions of the possibility of experience of
outer objects.

## How to determine the content of `<matter>`?

Watkins again: “what is the justification for each specific
determination that is added when one thinks of matter as having a
quantity, a quality, etc.? Also, what is the relationship between each
new determination of matter and the various claims that Kant makes in
each chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations? In particular, when Kant
explicitly invokes principles for constructing concepts belonging to the
possibility of matter, is his idea that these principles are required
insofar as they make experience of the relevant “new determination” of
matter possible (so that Kant would be developing a transcendental
argument in the Metaphysical Foundations similar in many respects to the
Critique of Pure Reason)?

# Kant and Scholastic science

Why does Kant have such a demanding conception of science? This question
doesn’t seem to have been asked by much of the major literature. But it
seems pretty clear that the answer is that he endorses, in many ways,
the scholastic conception of a demonstrative and explanatory science.

# Kant and mathematical construction

It has never been totally clear to me why Kant thinks that there is only
the possibility of proper science where there is the possibility of
applying mathematics. It is clear that the demand on science relates to
the issue of construction in pure intuition, but why *that* demand?

Presumably the demand for construction depends on the demand for real
definition. Since Kant seems to think that real definition is possible
only in mathematics, there could be no science that is not founded on
definitions made possible by mathematics. One would like to know more
precisely why such definition is possible in mathematics.
