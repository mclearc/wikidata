# Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect (1661)

Spinoza considers definition as requiring the explication of a thing in terms of its most fundamental properties, from which its other properties may be derived.

>For a definition to be regarded as complete, it must explain the inmost
>essence [95] of the thing, and must take care not to substitute for this any
>of its *propria*. To explicate this, passing over other examples so as not to
>appear bent on exposing the errors of others, I shall choose only the example
>of an abstract thing where the manner of definition is unimportant, a circle,
>say. If this is defined as a figure in which the lines drawn from the centre
>to the circumference are equal, it is obvious that such a definition by no
>means explains the essence of a circle, but only one of its properties. And
>although, as I have said, this is a matter of little importance when it is a
>question of figures and other mental constructs, it is nevertheless a matter
>of prime importance when it is a question of physical and real beings. For the
>properties of things are not understood as long as their essences are not
>known; and if the latter are neglected, this is bound to distort the
>interconnections made by our intellect which ought to reproduce the
>interconnections of Nature, and we shall go far astray from our goal.[^143757]

[^143757]: @spinoza2002, 25-6 (#94-5). The term 'propria' (propria being
the characteristics derived from the attributes of a thing) is substituted
for 'properties', otherwise the statement makes no sense. Cf.
[freudenthal2006](), 57-8.

Spinoza then provides the necessary and sufficient criteria for his
preferred notion of definition.

> 1. If the thing is created, the definition, as we have said, will have to
>    include the proximate cause. E.g., according to this law, a circle would
>    have to be defined as follows: it is the figure that is described by any
>    line of which one end is fixed and the other movable. This definition
>    clearly includes the proximate cause.

>2. We require a concept, or definition, of the thing such that when it is
>   considered alone, without any others conjoined, all the thing's properties
>   can be deduced from it (as may be seen in this definition of the circle).
>   For from it we clearly infer that all the lines drawn from the center to
>   the circumference are equal.[^145057]

Spinoza was here apparently greatly influenced by Hobbes. Gideon
Freudenthal cites the following sources:

>See Hobbes, *De Corpore* I,i,5, and his *Examinatio et emendatio mathematicae
>bodiernae*, second dialogue. On this conception of definition and its
>dependence on Hobbes (including the example given) see Ernst Cassirer, *Das
>Erkenntnisproblem* II, 90, 98ff; See also Cassirer's *Leibniz System*,
>110-117. Leibniz emphasizes the importance of the constructive definition (in
>contradistinction to a nominal definition) to ensure the "real possibility" of
>the entity. See GP I, 384-385. See especially "On Universal Synthesis and
>analysis, or the Art of discovery and Judgment", Loemker 229-233 (GP VII,
>292-298). Leibniz uses there a property of a circle (proven in Euclid III, 20)
>to argue that there are "paradoxical properties" (GP VII, 291, Loemker, 280)
>of which we at first do not know whether they are real or not.

There is also a very helpful discussion of these issues in [mancosu1999](),
ch. 4.1. Mancosu points out that 

>Hobbes and Spinoza emphasized the role of genetic definitions as the only
>causal definitions, thereby excluding the nongenetic definitions from the
>realm of science. This forced them, particularly Hobbes, to call for a
>revisionist philosophy of geometry in which motion would play a pivotal role.
>Indeed, Hobbes claimed to have been the first one to provide a foundation for
>geometry. Replying to Wallis, who had objected to his use of motion in the
>redefinition of many Euclidian concepts—proportion theory—Hobbes defiantly
>asserted it was through the use of motion that he had made the grounds of
>geometry coherent.[^151325]

[^151325]: @mancosu1999, 99.

In De Corpore Hobbes argued that the notion of science requires an appeal to genetic definitions:

>To return, therefore, to definitions; the reason why I say that the cause and
>generation of such things, as have any cause or generation, ought to enter
>into their definitions, is this. The end of the science is the demonstration
>of the causes and generations of things; which if they be not in the
>definitions, they cannot be found in the conclusion of the first syllogism,
>that is made from those definitions; and if they be not in the first
>conclusion, they will not be found in any other conclusion deduced from that;
>and, therefore, by proceeding in this manner, we shall never come to science;
>which is against the scope and intention of demonstration.[^151434]

Apparently, Gueroult argues for a direct influence of Hobbes on Spinoza and lists 'an impressive number of similarities' between their conceptions of geometry.

Freudenthal argues that Spinoza's views here are similar to those
expressed by Kant in several places. Freudenthal cites Kant's definition of a circle as "a line in the plane to which all lines drawn from one point are perpendicular." (AA 14, 23 drawing on Euclid's *Elements* III, 18 and implying proposition III, 35. For yet another such definition see AA 14, 31.See also Kant's Letter to Carl Leonhard Reinhold May 19, 1789, AA XII, p. 43.
