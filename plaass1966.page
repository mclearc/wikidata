# Overview #

## Metaphysical Construction  ##

Plaass understands Kant's project in the MFNS as one of 'metaphysical
construction'.[^14541] Watkins defines things this way in his [
dissertation](watkins1994)
([PDF](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/watkins1994.pdf?page=224)),

>A metaphysical construction does not construct intuitions corresponding to a
concept, as a mathematical construction would, but rather a concept that
indicates how a particular object (in this case, matter) must be represented
merely according to the general laws of thought, namely according to the laws
of thinking an object that is to have existence. In other words, a metaphysical
construction moves from a pure, undetermined form of thinking an object in
general (a category) to a determinate, discursive concept, reconstructed on the
basis of the content of the empirical concept at hand according to the
subjective conditions of thought. In short, a metaphysical construction
combines an empirical concept’s content and a pure form of thought to form a
determinate concept. Thus, the *MAdN*'s metaphysical construction produces a
determinate concept by taking the content of the concept matter and
representing it according to the general laws of thought.[^14840]

[^14840]: @watkins1994, 225.

[^14541]: He defends this idea of construction by appeal to the Preface,
XIV.  
    > “Um deswillen habe ich für nötig gehalten, von dem reinen Teile der Naturwissenschaft (physica generalis), wo metaphysische und mathematische Konstruktionen durch einander zu laufen pflegen, die erstere, und mit ihnen zugleich die Prinzipien der Konstruktion dieser Begriffe, also der
    Möglichkeit einer mathematischen Naturlehre selbst, in einem System darzustellen”: “For that reason I thought it necessary regarding the pure part of natural science (physica generalis), in which metaphysical and mathematical constructions tend to become confused, to portray in a system the former, and with it at the same time the principles of the construction of these concepts, thus of the possibility of a mathematical doctrine of nature itself”.

I confess to finding this interpretation---viz. Plaass's---of 'construction'
totally obscure. At the very least it seems too general. Surely all empirical
concepts owe their 'determinacy' (whatever exactly that is) at least in part to
the categories. 

What's more, on Plaass's reading metaphysical construction only shows
that we possess the concept, it does not demonstrate the objective
validity of the concept. It still requires a 'transcendental deduction'
to show its validity. Watkins again,

>Although the *MAdN* provides a metaphysical construction of the concept of
matter (with respect to its content) [thus showing that we possess the
concept], Plaass argues that a transcendental deduction (with respect to the
real existence of matter) is not possible, since the objective reality of the
determinate concept of matter can be shown only a posteriori. Plaass suggests
that it is precisely this aspect of the concept of matter which justifies
Kant’s characterization of the concept of matter as empirical.[^15521]

## The Predicable Interpretation

A 'predicable' is a combination of various categories, or of a category with a sensible element (cf. [watkins1994](), 226).
