# The Pre-Critical Kant on Explanatory Grounds

In the *New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition*,
from 1755, Kant presents a framework for understanding grounding explanations
of the kind necessary for a proper science.[^7] Kant’s notion of a ‘ground’
[*ratio*, *Grund*] is that of a relation between subject and predicate such
that the subject is ‘determined’ [*determinatum*] to have a particular
predicate, as opposed to its opposite (NE 1:391, 393). He distinguishes two
kinds of ground or reason—viz. ‘antecedently’ [*antecedenter*] and
‘consequently’ [*consequenter*] determining grounds.[^8]

> That which determines a subject in respect of any of its predicates,
> is called the *ground*. *Grounds* may be differentiated into those
> which are antecedently determining and those which are consequentially
> determining. An *antecedently* determining ground is one, the concept
> of which precedes that which is determined, i.e. that in the absence
> of which what is determined would not be intelligible. A
> *consequentially* determining ground is one which would not be posited
> [*poneretur*] unless the concept which is determined by it had not
> already been posited from some other source. You can also call the
> former the reason *why*, or the ground of being or becoming
> [*rationem*cur\* scilicet essendi vel fiendi\*], while the latter can
> be called the ground *that*, or the ground of knowing [*rationem* quod
> *scilicet cognoscendi*] (NE 1:391-2)

Kant articulates these notions of ground for epistemic purposes. His
concern is with the basis upon which we assent or deny the truth of a
particular proposition. Kant’s idea seems to be that, for any
proposition, there must be some basis to which one can point that would
allow one to decide between the truth of a proposition and its negation.
If there were not, then we would have to suspend judgment concerning the
proposition since each of its ‘two predicates [i.e. the predicate or its
negation] remains possible, neither being established as true in respect
of our knowledge’ (NE 1:392). 

Two kinds of knowledge are then possible. Knowledge of the consequently
determining ground is *knowledge that* one of these predicates is excluded in
favor of the other (NE 1:393, 396). Knowledge of the antecedently
determining ground provides not only knowledge that one predicate is
excluded in favor of another, but also *why* this is the case. 

One illustrative example Kant provides is that of the ground of evil in
the world (NE 1:392). Our *consequently* determining ground for
assenting to the proposition that there is evil in the world is our own
experience of such evil. So, with regard to the question ‘is there
evil?’ our experience provides us the basis for a positive answer. It is
sufficient for us to decide between the propositions ‘there is evil’ and
‘there is no evil’. But this only gives a reason for thinking *that*
there is evil in the world, not *why* there is such evil.[^9] An
*antecedently* determining ground would give us such a reason why by
giving us not merely the fact of evil’s existence, but that in virtue of
which it exists.

Despite its epistemic emphasis, Kant’s notion of ground is also *ontological*.
In the example of the ground of evil, Kant’s notion of the antecedently
determining ground is not simply one which gives an answer to a why question,
but rather does so *because* it is the metaphysical basis of the evil. As Kant
puts it, the “determining ground is not only the criterion of truth; it is also
its source.” (NE 1:392). This could be the case for one of two reasons. On the
one hand, the ground could be a necessary condition of there being evil. Thus,
a full explanation of why evil exists would have to include this ground. But,
on the other hand, since all the necessary conditions of evil's existing could
obtain and yet evil not exist, one must also ask after the sufficient
conditions of this existence---i.e. after the *cause* of evil's
existence.[^111453] Alternately put, an antecedently determining ground is a
ground of ‘being or becoming’ [*essendi vel fiendi*], and it is precisely due
to the generative status of the ground that it has its explanatory status (NE
1:396-7, 398).
<!-- NOTE: this isn't quite right since one could have merely knowledge that one thing causes another, without knowing *why* it does so. So what's missing? Presumably the fact that a determining ground *excludes* other predicates is significant, so the idea is that the ground tells us why this feature rather than another is predicated of the thing -->

[^111453]:  There is a helpful discussion of the pre-critical Kant on
grounds in [watkins2005](), 113 note 10, 119-29. Cf. [longuenesse2001]().

Consider again the proposition 'there is evil in the world'. To have knowledge
of a determining ground for this proposition is to have knowledge that excludes
the proposition's negation. In the case of a consequently determining ground,
such as one's experience of evil, the basis for 'excluding' the opposing
proposition---viz. 'it is not the case that there is evil in the world'---is
something that is a result or effect of the truth of the proposition in
question---i.e of the fact that makes 'there is evil in the world' true. So
one's ground for knowing the proposition 'there is evil in the world'---e.g.
one's experience---is a *consequence* of there being a fact which obtains and
makes that proposition true---viz. the fact that there is evil in the
world.[^12586]

[^12586]: This assumes that the knowledge is not transmitted by other
means, e.g. testimony. 

In the case of knowledge of antecedently determining grounds, one's
knowledge is *not* a consequence of the fact which makes the proposition
in question true, but rather knowledge of that which accounts for the
existence of the fact in question. In this case, the ground for
affirming the truth of 'there is evil in the world' is not a consequence
of the existence of the proposition's truth-maker, but rather explains
why that truth-maker exists. In the case of evil, this might be
knowledge of god's motives or intentions. To put things another way, if
the proposition in question were the consequent of a material
conditional, then one's knowledge of an antecedently determining ground
would be knowledge of the antecedent to that conditional. However, this
is slightly misleading, since there is more than logical connection at
work. Rather, the antecedent must also have explanatory priority. 

We might better distinguish the central notions Kant is getting at by
distinguishing between an *explanatory* ground and a *factual* ground.
Both are ontological notions. They refer to object, states, events,
properties, etc. Both are also epistemic in that they provide knowledge.
An explanatory ground gives one reason for *both* holding that
something is true and that gives knowledge of why. A factual ground
merely gives reason for holding that something is true. 

# Real vs. Logical Grounds #

In the ramp-up to the critical period Kant makes a new distinction vis-a
-vis grounds, between the logical and the real ground.[^16425] In the
Herder Lecture notes Kant says,

>A ground is thus something by which, having been posited, something else is
>posited. Crusius describes the ground through which something is brought
>about. The word bring about is much too composite: for not all effects are
>consequences and not all powers [a] ground. Every ground is either logical, by
>means of which the consequence that is identical to it is posited as a
>predicate according to the rule of identity, or real, by means of which the
>consequence that is not identical to it is not posited according to the rule
>of identity. (28:11)

[^16425]: See the discussion in @watkins2005, 162-5. [PDF](skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/watkins2005.pdf?page=175)

So to know the logical ground of a thing is to know what follows from
the concept of it, in this case, that the predicate which is (covertly)
contained in the subject (or identical with it) follows from the subject.
Knowledge of a real ground is knowledge of a non-conceptual, non-logical
necessitation relation, and thus is not one derivable by means of appeal
to the principles of identity or non-contradiction. 

Interestingly, Kant seems to deny the intelligibility of connections
between real grounds. 

>The connection between the logical ground and con- sequence is comprehensible,
>but not that between the real ground, that when something is posited,
>something else would be posited at the same time: example: God wills! – There
>became the world!” (28:12)

[Watkins](watkins2005) puts it this way,

> we cannot rationally grasp the connection between a real ground and its
> effect. That is, we cannot infer solely on the basis of reason or the
> principle of contradiction that an effect necessarily follows from its real
> ground.[^175725]

[^175725]: @watkins2005, 163.

Further quoted by Watkins, Kant seems to go even further by claiming that

> every determination of things, however, that requires a real ground, is
> posited by something else, and the connection of a real ground with the real
> consequence is thus not comprehended [eingesehen] from the rule of identity,
> also cannot be expressed by a judgment, but is rather a simple concept. . .
> . Only through experience can we have insight [einsehen] into the connection
> of the real ground, not logically (28:24).

I think this has to be a position that Kant renounces in the critical
period since it seems, at least in the case of mathematics, that we know
the real ground of the objects of mathematics insofar as they admit of
construction in pure intuition. 

# Ground and the A Priori #

Kant’s notion of an antecendently determining ground is one which
provides properly scientific knowledge, in the sense that it does not
merely provide one with true information, but in addition, with the
reason or explanation why something is the case. Such knowledge, in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was typically regarded as a priori,
not because (as in our contemporary usage) it could be known
independently of experience, but rather because experience could only
provide knowledge of consequently determining grounds—i.e. knowledge
that something is the case.
<!-- TODO: This paragraph might need to be radically expanded. Certainly it is going to be repetitive given what I say in the next subsection (which itself probably should be deleted). At the very least I should explain why experience can only provide such limited knowledge -->
<!-- NOTE: See discussion by Crusius at skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/watkins2009.pdf?page=159 -->
<!-- TODO: incorporate discussion of Smit concerning insight vs. understanding: skimmer:///Users/Roambot/Dropbox/PDFLibrary/smit2009.pdf?page=19 and following -->

A priori knowability in this (now archaic) sense of knowledge of that in virtue
of which something is the case, and not merely that it is the case, was widely
held in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be the epistemic ideal
towards which all doxastic states aim.[^10] The influential *Port Royal Logic*
of Arnauld and Nicole includes a definition of the a priori in terms of the
‘demonstration of effects by their causes.’[^11] Leibniz argued that there is
“no true or existent fact, no true assertion, without there being a sufficient
reason why it is thus and not otherwise.”[^12] Even closer to Kant, Wolff
provides a general definition of ground in terms of ‘that through which one can
understand why something [i.e. what is grounded] is the case.’[^13] Kant’s
pre-critical conception of an antecedently determining ground seems to
straightforwardly connect with these older notions.[^14]

## Insight and the A Priori ##

Kant distinguishes between different levels of cognitive achievement in
the Jäsche Logic.

>In regard to the objective content of our cognition in general, we may think
the following degrees, in accordance with which cognition can, in this respect,
be graded:
    * The first degree of cognition is: to represent something [*sich etwas
      vorstellen*];
    * The second: to represent something with consciousness, or to perceive
      (*percipere*) [*sich mit Bewußtsein etwas vorstellen oder wahrnehmen*];
    * The third: to be acquainted with something (noscere), or to represent
      something in comparison with other things [*etwas kennen oder sich etwas
      in der Vergleichung mit anderen Dingen vorstellen*], both as to sameness
      and as to difference;
    * The fourth: to be acquainted with something with consciousness, i.e. to
      cognize it (*cognoscere*) [*mit Bewußtsein etwas kennen, d.h. erkennen*].
      Animals are acquainted with objects too, but they do not cognize them
      [*Die Thiere kennen auch Gegenstände, aber sie erkennen sie nicht*]
    * The fifth: to understand [*verstehen*] something (*intelligere*), i.e.,
      to cognize something *through the understanding by means of concepts*, or
      to *conceive* [*concipiren*]. One can conceive much, although one cannot
      comprehend it, e.g., a *perpetuum mobile*, whose impossibility is shown
      in mechanics.
    * The sixth: to cognize something through reason, or *to have insight* [*
      einsehen*] into it (*perspicere*). With few things do we get this far,
      and our cognitions become fewer and fewer in number the more that we seek
      to perfect them as to content.
    * The *seventh, finally: to comprehend* [*begreifen*] something
      (*comprehendere*), i.e., to cognize something through reason or *a
      priori* to the degree that is sufficient for our purpose. For all our
      comprehension is only *relative*, i.e., sufficient for a certain purpose;
      we do not comprehend anything *without qualification*. Nothing can be
      comprehended more than what the mathematician demonstrates, e.g., that
      all lines in the circle are proportional. And yet he does not comprehend
      how it happens that such a simple figure has these properties. The field
      of understanding or of the understanding is thus in general much greater
      than the field of comprehension or of reason. (JL 9:64–5; my emphasis;
      cf. LL 24:846; A311/B367).]

It seems plausible to me that the sixth and seventh levels are levels of
cognitive achievment in which one has some explanation of the subject
matter in question. 

With respect to comprehension one would have available a demonstration (i.e. a
syllogism) in which those characteristics which are fundamental or priori in
the order of being are also fundamental or priori in the order of explanation.

    345-74; @longuenesse2001; @berg2014, ch. 2; @smit2009.

[^8]: Though Kant here puts the notion of a determining ground in terms
    of subject-predicate relations (and their corresponding
    substance-accident relations), by the mid 1760s Kant is also clear
    that the relation is one which can also hold between propositions.
    In Herder’s metaphysics lecture notes from this period
    (cf. 28:12-13, as well as Kant’s 1763 work on *Negative Magnitudes*
    (2:202-4) we see Kant distinguishing ground and consequent in terms
    of what is *inferred* (e.g. 2:203). By the critical period, Kant is
    also interchangebly talking of antecedently and consequently
    determining grounds with hypothetical modes of inference—viz. modus
    ponens and modus tollens respectively (e.g. JL 9:52). Importantly,
    only inferences of the modus ponens form are in a position to
    provide knowledge *why* something is the case. See also
    @longuenesse2001, 74-5. I discuss this issue further below.
    <!-- NOTE: Should this be in the body of the paper rather than in a footnote? -->

[^9]: @berg2014 construes consequently determining grounds in terms of
    ‘subjective justification’ (27). This must be incorrect, at least as
    a description of Kant’s position, since theoretical justification
    cannot ever be *subjective*, though it requires subjective causes to
    occur. As Kant puts it in the critical period, assent is “an
    occurrence in our understanding that may rest on objective grounds,
    but that also requires subjective causes [Ursachen] in the mind of
    him who judges” (A820/B848; cf. LL 24:162, 851, 879).

    epistemic ideal. This ideal was often pursued in terms of the
    ‘*Regressus*’ theory of the Paduan Aristotelians. Cf. @randall1961 ;
