## Overview ##  


**Overview:** This is a detailed overview of Kant's theory of mathematics, particularly mathematical construction, in the critical period. However, I find some of the discussion of construction quite opaque, so I'm not particularly confident that this is a suitable introductory article. I'm also not terribly confident of the correctness of the overall account. Shabel moves too quickly over crucial details, such as how construction entails cognitive access, or what exactly the role of space is in the construction of particular geometric objects. There is also little to no discussion of the issue of existence with respect to mathematical objects (including issues of real possibility and objective validity).  ([p.94][262k])

## Summary Text ##  


"The syntheticity of geometry and arithmetic is ultimately due to the fact that their propositions codify and describe the content of our original a priori representations of space and time, which are pre- sented in intuition and not through mere concepts. The construction of mathematical concepts in intuition thus serves more generally to reveal or exhibit the sensible conditions that warrant and constrain mathematical judgment." ([p.107][342z])  

[342z]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#14

"For Kant to provide a coherent philosophy of mathe- matics and defend his central thesis that mathematical cognition is synthetic and a priori, he owes us an account of how the mathe- matician’s constructive practices can provide evidence for and sup- port arguments that lead to fully general and universal mathematical propositions." ([p.108][352k])  

[352k]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#15

"On Kant’s view, then, the act of construction in accordance with a rule transmits generality and universality to mathemati- cal representations. It follows that the mathematical judgments that relate such general and universal mathematical representa- tions themselves hold generally and apply universally. For the same reasons, mathematical judgments are known with apodictic cer- tainty and so are a priori: because Kant takes the pure spatiotem- poral intuition on which mathematical propositions are grounded to be both a “subjective condition regarding form” and a “univer- sal a priori condition” of experience, mathematical propositions are necessarily true. Thus, on Kant’s view, we can be apodictically certain that the synthetic propositions of pure mathematics are gen- erally true of and apply universally to all spatiotemporal objects of experience." ([p.113][347q])

## Important ##  


**Important:**    
"Mathematical concepts are thus given through syn- thetic definitions, which prescribe a rule or pattern for constructing a corresponding intuition.13" ([p.99][534e])  

[534e]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#6

**Important:**    
"To “take account only of the action of constructing” a shape, and thereby to ascribe features to the shape not only as it is given in its general a priori concept but also as it is determined by more general features of the spatial mode of construction, is to display the general content of a mathematical concept in a particular concrete entity. The general cognitive conditions that govern mathematical thought and ground mathematical reasoning are thus accessible via the performance of mental acts that produce singular and concrete representations." ([p.112][555n])

## Highlighted Text ##  




**Interesting:**    
"Wolff thus articulates a philosophy of mathematics according to which the rigorous logical analysis of mathematical concepts and propositions is sufficient to account for mathemati- cal truth. Moreover, philosophical inquiry is to be modeled on the prototype of mathematical analysis." ([p.95][567s])  

[567s]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#2

**Interesting:**    
"Wolff takes every step of a mathematical demonstration to rest on conceptual analysis and syllogistic inference, and thus conceives of diagrammatic evidence as reducible to logical evidence." ([p.95][519r])  

[519r]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#2

**Interesting:**    
"Kant is concerned with the same issues about the mathematical method and the certainty of mathematical proposi- tions as are his predecessors. But he is concerned to show, contrary to the views of his predecessors, that the method that yields mathemat- ical certainty is unique and cannot be assimilated to the conceptual analysis that occupies philosophy. In the course of so distinguishing the mathematical from the philosophical method, Kant articulates a coherent and compelling philosophy of mathematics that engages with the mathematical practice of his time and that moreover serves his own metaphysical and epistemological purposes in a variety of ways" ([p.97][579z])

**Quote:**    
"conceptual syntheses: a predicate con- cept not already contained in the subject concept is shown to “belong to” the subject concept nonetheless, thus issuing in a true mathematical judgment." ([p.98][595t])  

[595t]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#5

**Interesting:**    
"Kant conceives mathematics to have a unique ability to define its concepts by constructing them, which amounts to exhibiting their content in the form of a singular representation, or intuition. In producing a figure in intuition, the mathematician defines a mathematical concept by constructing an individual figure to correspond to that concept." ([p.99][546c])  

[546c]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#6

**Interesting:**    
"The arithmetician’s strokes differ from the geome- ter’s figure in that the former use spatial distinctness not to rep- resent qualitative spatial magnitudes, such as shapes, but only to represent discrete quantitative units. Thus the stroke, despite being ostensive, is nevertheless a more abstract mathematical tool than might appear from its sensible rendering." ([p.100][568r])  

[568r]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#7

**Interesting:**    
"Kant does not use “symbolic construction” to designate a category of mathematical constructions that are constructed out of symbols, and thereby distinct from osten- sive constructions. He rather uses “symbolic construction” to des- ignate that which symbolizes ostensive constructions." ([p.101][532t])  

[532t]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#8

**Interesting:**    
"the procedure and result of all mathematical construction is, for Kant, fundamen- tally ostensive: to construct a mathematical concept one necessarily exhibits an intuition that displays its features manifestly." ([p.101][574x])  

[574x]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#8

**Interesting:**    
"Here Kant argues against the analyticity of all arithmetic propositions by argu- ing against the analyticity of a representative numerical formula." ([p.102][593l])  

[593l]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#9

**Interesting:**    
"The positive argument for the syntheticity of arithmeti- cal propositions begins with a claim that depends on Kant’s con- structibility thesis, discussed earlier: to grasp the relation between the subject and predicate concepts of an arithmetic proposition, one must “go beyond” the subject concept to the intuition that corre- sponds to it and identify properties that are not analytically con- tained in the concept, yet still belong to it (B 15; A 718/B 746). Kant holds therefore that construction of the concept of the sum of 7 and 5 is necessary if we are seeking grounds for judging whether the propo- sition “7 + 5 = 12” is true or false. By constructing the concept of the sum, we are able to judge that the concept of the sum of 7 and 5 has the property of being equal to 12, even though that property is not analytically contained in the concept of the sum of 7 and 5" ([p.103][513z])  

[513z]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#10

**Interesting:**    
"Kant’s point is that, even if we have a shortcut (perhaps symbolic) method for performing large num- ber arithmetic calculations, the relations among large number con- cepts must be justified on intuitive, and thus synthetic, grounds" ([p.104][541a])  

[541a]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#11

**Interesting:**    
"Kant takes this particular judgment to be axiomatic because the synthesis between the concepts is immediately evident: upon constructing a straight line between two points, and thereby exhibiting the content of the subject concept of the proposition, one judges immediately, without any mediating inferences, that the straight line so constructed like- wise exhibits the content of the predicate concept." ([p.105][542i])  

[542i]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#12

**Interesting:**    
"I must emphasize Kant’s insight that the construc- tion of the triangle, and the auxiliary constructions of the lines and angles adjacent to the triangle, provide information to the geome- ter that was not contained within the concepts that compose the proposition to be proved, namely, that the three interior angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles. That this proposition cannot be deduced by analysis of the concepts of angle, triangle, etc., but can be deduced by construction of those same concepts, Kant gleans from the geometer’s own practice." ([p.106][535k])  

[535k]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#13

**Interesting:**    
"The key point here is Kant’s recognition that the geometer’s proof cannot succeed without information about the relations among the spatial regions delimited by the triangle and its external angles, infor- mation that is unavailable to the philosopher examining the bare concept of a triangle. Kant understood that the constructed figure in Euclid’s proof is not a heuristic aid to understanding, but rather an essential and ineliminable component of the reasoning that leads the geometer from the interior angles of a triangle, “through a chain of inferences that is always guided by intuition,” to the sum of two right angles." ([p.107][543c])  

[543c]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#14

**Interesting:**    
"Because Kant takes mathematics to be built upon the basic propositions of arithmetic and geometry, he takes his arguments for the syntheticity of the propositions of arithmetic and geometry to constitute an argument for the syntheticity of all mathe- matical propositions" ([p.107][512x])  

[512x]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#14

**Interesting:**    
"the shapes we construct in a mathematical context are not abstracted from our sensible impressions of shaped objects, such as plates or tables. Rather, on Kant’s view, our empirical intuitions of shaped objects borrow their patterns from our pure intuitions of shapes in space." ([p.109][538a])  

[538a]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#16

**Interesting:**    
"Kant’s main argument in support of the claim that mathematical propositions are fully general and universal is that the concept con- structions on which they rest, despite producing singular and con- crete intuitions, are themselves fully general and universal processes resulting in fully general and universal representations. It will follow that mathematical propositions relating such constructible concepts are fully general and universal. The question is: What makes concept construction a fully general and universal process resulting in fully general and universal representations?" ([p.108][582q])  

[582q]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#15

**Interesting:**    
"Because Kant construes mathematical con- cepts like triangle to contain such determinate construction proce- dures, mathematical concepts like triangle provide us with rules for representing the objects that instantiate them. Thus, there is no het- erogeneity between mathematical concepts and the intuitions that directly correspond to them via construction: the pure mathemat- ical concept triangle is homogeneous with all pure and empirical intuitions of triangles, and so with all triangular objects of experi- ence, since the concept triangle provides us with the rule for rep- resenting any three-sided rectilinear object" ([p.111][584u])  

[584u]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#18

**Interesting:**    
"Mathematical schemata thus have the generality of a concept (since they represent the general content of a mathematical concept) but the particularity of an intuition (since they issue in a concrete display of that content). Kant denies, however, that such schemata are images" ([p.111][524z])  

[524z]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#18



**Interesting:**    
"As Kant sees it, then, the act of construction is the ultimate source of the full generality and universality of intuitive mathematical rep- resentations." ([p.110][598m])  

[598m]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#17

**Disagree:**    
"That mathematical concepts can be synthetically defined and constructed makes it possible for us to have direct cognitive access to such general mathematical patterns" ([p.110][535o])  

[535o]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#17

**Interesting:**    
"The synthetic a priori propositions of mathematics, he claims, are “derived from” these a priori intuitions of space and time and so are grounded by our pure sensible faculty." ([p.114][591i])  

[591i]: customurl://com.hackademic.AppleScript.URL_Handler?action=1$Dropbox/PDFLibrary/shabel2006.pdf#21

**Interesting:**    
"the doctrine of transcendental realism contradicts the synthetic apriority of mathematics, which itself rests on the a priori intuitivity of space and time. Therefore, transcendental realism must be rejected in favor of transcendental idealism." ([p.115][538c])
