# Intrinsic Properties and Derivation #

Langton argues that Kant's position, both in his 1755 *Nova Dilucidatio*
and his 1786 MFNS, is that nothing follows from the existence of a thing
with its set of intrinsic properties concerning what powers or
relational properties that thing will have. 

>Kant said in 1755 that from [174] the mere existence of a thing, with its
>intrinsic properties, no conclusions follow about how that thing will relate
>to other things. Playing out this form of argument in the context of a theory
>of matter yields a conclusion about the connection between primary and
>tertiary qualities. It does not follow from the mere existence of a thing,
>with its primary qualities, that the thing will have certain tertiary quality
>powers of relating to other things. And in this particular application, it
>does not follow from the mere existence of a 'solid' body, where solidity is
>supposed to be an absolute or intrinsic property, that the body will be
>impenetrable. Impenetrability does not follow logically from solidity. That is
>the point of Kant's joke; *der Satz des Widerspruchs treibt keine Materie
>zuruck*. The principle of contradiction doesn't drive matter back!
>(@langton1998, 173-4)

Langton thinks that Kant's argument against Lambert in MFNS 4:497-8 indicates
this, as well as his discussion of determination in the ND of 1755. I think
that Langton is mistaken, or at least too quick. Kant can hold that (as against
Lambert) the principle of contradiction applied to the concept `<substance>` or
`<solidity>` cannot yield the conclusion that some particular body will offer
resistance without thereby accepting her claim, that the resistance which a
body offers is made possible or explained by, or otherwise *grounded in*, its
solidity. Kant's point is that we cannot *know* or otherwise *cognize*
the relationship between matter, substance, and solidity than by seeing
their actions in the course of experience. Put another way, Kant's
denial that there is a secure logical ground by means of which we can
make claims about particular bodies (as opposed to concepts which
subsume them) does not entail his denial that there is some metaphysical
grounding relationship between some of a body's features and others.
