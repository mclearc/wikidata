>How is it possible to intuit something *a priori*? An intuition is a
representation of the sort which would depend immediately on the presence of an
object. It therefore seems impossible originally to intuit *a priori*, since
then the intuition would have to occur without an object being present, either
previously or now, to which it could relate, and so it could not be an
intuition. *Prolegomena*, 4:281-2.
