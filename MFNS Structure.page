# Structure of the Work

0. Preface (4:467-79)
1. Phoronomy (4:480-495)
2. Dynamics (4:496-535)
3. Mechanics (4:536-53)
4. Phenomenology (4:554-65)

The Dynamics is the longest chapter by far, and typically the one that
commentators focus upon. 

<!-- TODO: Give a basic summary of the argument of the work, maybe borrow from Watkins -->
