# Structure of the Work

0. Preface (4:467-79)
1. Phoronomy (4:480-495)
2. Dynamics (4:496-535)
3. Mechanics (4:536-53)
4. Phenomenology (4:554-65)

The Dynamics is the longest chapter by far, and typically the one that
commentators focus upon. 

<!-- TODO: Give a basic summary of the argument of the work, maybe borrow from Watkins -->

# Summary of the Chapters


## Preface ##

- Physics, as a proper science, needs a 'pure' part
- A pure basis for physics has two parts---viz. transcendental and special
    + Transcendental part provided by wholly general principles from CPR
    + Special part requires a given empirical concept---viz. `<matter>` (for
      physics)

## Phoronomy ##

>*Matter* is the *movable* in space. That space which is itself movable is
>called material, or also *relative space*; that in which all *motion* must
>finally be thought (and which is therefore itself absolutely immovable) is
>called pure, or also *absolute space*. (4:480)


## Dynamics ##

>*Matter* is the *movable* insofar as it *fills* a *space*. To *fill* a space
>is to resist every movable that strives through its motion to penetrate into a
>certain space. A space that is not filled is an *empty space*. (4:496)

## Mechanics ##

>Matter is the movable insofar as it, as such a thing, has moving force.
(4:536)

## Phenomenology ##

>Matter is the movable insofar as it, as such a thing, can be an object of
>experience. (4:554)
