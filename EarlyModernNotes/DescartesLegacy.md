# Descartes's Legacy #

Descartes's had lasting influence, both positive and negative, on
philosophy and the development of scientific theory. We'll look
briefly at a few examples of this, relevant to our reading.

## Descartes on Method ##

The scholastic Aristotelian view of scientific knowledge, to which
Descartes and others were reacting, viewed all scientific knowledge
as demonstrative. In this, Descartes did not disagree. He did,
however, offer an alternative conception of what in which our most
fundamental knowledge consisted and how (or via what cognitive
faculties) we went about getting that knowledge.

Descartes's aim was to provide the foundations for a stable and
lasting science. He contributed two methodological
innovations---viz., the method of doubt and the method of clear and
vivid perception. 

The method of doubt inaugurated a new focus on epistemological issues
and the understanding of knowledge in terms of the immunity to
skeptical doubt. The issue of what, if any, knowledge is immune to
skeptical doubt is of [ongoing
interest](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/) in
[epistemology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/#SKE).
The method of doubt also contributed to an emphasis on the
contributions of the pure intellect (or pure reason), rather than the
senses, to the acquisition of knowledge. While this is an idea that
goes back to [Plato](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/), it
finds newfound life with Descartes and is upheld by several other
continental 'rationalists', such as
[Malebranche](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/malebranche/),
[Spinoza](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/), and
[Leibniz](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/).

The method of clear and vivid perception was an important part of
continental rationalism, and helped to encourage the view that
rational insight or 'intellectual intuition' is an important source
of knowledge. In particular, the idea that substantive knowledge
might be available independent of any experience, or '*[a priori](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/apriori/)*' became the basis of an important dispute between continental rationalists and British empiricists. The existence and extent of a priori knowledge remains a basic question in epistemology.  

Finally, Descartes's 'epistemic turn' emphasized the methodological
importance of investigating the nature and role of the cognitive
faculties in the acquisition of knowledge. This would be a major
theme in the work of thinkers as diverse as Malebranche, Locke, Hume,
Reid, and Kant. 

## The *Cogito* ##

Aside from the skeptical issues raised by the method of doubt, by far
the most influential of Descartes's arguments was the *Cogito*
argument, which was important both for its putative role in constructing a [foundationalist epistemology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/), and
its apparent result in apprehending oneself as a thinking thing. 

## Physics & Theory of Matter ##

In establishing his metaphysical basis for natural science, Descartes
argues that the essence of matter is *extension*, and thus that all
the features of material bodies must be understood in terms of
modifications, or 'modes', of this one central property (e.g. size, 
shape, location, motion; cf. [the wax argument](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mclearc/ModernPhilosophyNotes/blob/master/Meditation%202.html#the-wax-argument-knowledge-of-body)). 
This was an important change from scholastic Aristotelian theories, 
which held that material bodies were to be understood in terms of 
such properties as heat, cold, wetness, and dryness. It also meant 
that Descartes made no real distinction between the space occupied 
by a body and the body itself. Since all that body essentially is, 
on Descartes's view, is extension in three dimensions, there is no 
fundamental difference between physical matter and space. The 
perception of 'empty' space is thus merely the perception of a space 
occupied by 'rarefied' matter (i.e. the volume of 'space' is of 
lesser density); it is not a 'container' which matter 
might occupy.
