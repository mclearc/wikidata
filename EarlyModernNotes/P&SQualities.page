title: 'The Primary/Secondary Quality Distinction'
...

# Background

Aristotle distinguishes between primary and secondary qualities in his
discussion of generation and change (*On Generation and Corruption*, bk.
II). He argues that we should distinguish between qualities that are
responsible or otherwise explain the coming-to-be and passing-away of
things (primary qualities) and qualities which are distinct from these,
which are features of things, and which are explained by appeal to
relationships among the primary qualities.

Primary qualities for Aristotle include hot, cold, wet, dry. These
qualities are the basic explanatory building blocks for things.
Relationships amongst these qualities define the four basic
elements—viz. earth, air, fire, and water—out of which everything was
thought to be made.

The Aristotelian distinction understood the primary qualities as
qualities that were manifest to our senses, and thus understood the
physical world—nature—as the kind of thing whose fundamental features
were primarily intelligible via the senses. This would all change by the
seventeenth century.

# Mechanism & Materialism

The seventeenth century saw the rise of two distinct but related
positions: *mechanism* and *materialism*. *Materialism* is a
metaphysical theory concerning the natural world. It claims that the
natural world consists fundamentally of a kind of *stuff* — matter — and
that this stuff, organized in various ways according to natural laws as
characterized by physics, determines the nature and features of all the
objects we experience as part of the objective (and thus
mind-independent) natural world. Materialism thus says that there is
fundamentally only one kind of thing — matter. Materialism thus stands
in opposition to a *dualist* view like that articulated by Descartes.
Descartes argues that there are fundamentally *two* kinds of thing —
matter, and mind — and that the natural world consists of these two
kinds of thing interacting with one another, sometimes in very special
ways (as with the ensouled bodies of human beings).

*Mechanism* is part of a theory of *explanation*. Lisa Downing puts it
this way,

> [Mechanistic doctrine] states that all macroscopic bodily phenomena
> should be explained in terms of the motions and impacts of
> submicroscopic particles, or corpuscles, each of which can be fully
> characterized in terms of a strictly limited range of (primary)
> properties: size, shape, motion (or mobility), and, perhaps, solidity
> or impenetrability. (@downing1998, 381)

A ‘corpuscle’ is a extremely small parcel of matter with a determinate
size, shape, motion, location, etc. It is the features of individual
corpuscles, plus their interactions, which mechanism takes to explain
the characteristics and behavior of the material world. Locke sometimes
frames mechanism in terms of what he calls the ‘corpuscularian
hypothesis’.

> I have argued for this [viz., our knowledge of the features and
> behaviour of material bodies] in terms of the *corpuscularian
> hypothesis*—·the theory that all the workings of the material world
> are to be understood in terms of collisions between tiny portions of
> matter, tiny corpuscles·—because that’s the theory that is thought to
> go furthest in intelligibly explaining those qualities of bodies
> (IV.iii.16).

There is a great deal to be said about both doctrines, and their
development and influence in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
But here I focus on just one issue—the specific properties corpuscles
were thought to have, and the explanatory role of these properties
relative to all the other apparent characteristics of objects.

Notice two things about mechanism. First, it ultimately concerns
unobservable, or at least, *unobserved* entities (corpuscles). This
means that the explanation of observable phenomena depends on the
existence and characteristics of unobserved phenomena. This, in and of
itself, is a dramatically anti-Aristotelian move. The fundamental
explanatory level of reality is one which is removed from our direct
apprehension in experience.

Second, the explanatorily relevant features of corpuscles are primarily
their *geometric* properties—viz., size, shape, location, and state of
motion. What are not included are those features which we might think of
as tied to specific ways of sensing the world—e.g. their colors, tastes,
or smells.[^1] This bifurcation in explanatory role meant both that
greater emphasis was placed on our *mathematical* understanding of the
natural world, and that our purely sensory grasp of the natural world no
longer played a significant role (perhaps no role at all) in telling us
how and why the world appears to us as it does.

# Galileo on Real Qualities

## Background: Galileo (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642)

[Galileo Galilee](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/galileo/) was an
Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played
a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include
improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations
and support for
[Copernicanism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/).

His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic
confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest
satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the
observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied
science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other
instruments.

Galileo’s championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his
lifetime, when most subscribed to some form of the Ptolemaic geocentric
system. He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted
heliocentrism for various reasons. The matter was investigated by the
Roman Inquisition in 1615, and they concluded that it could be supported
as only a possibility, not an established fact. Galileo later defended
his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which
appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the
Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. In 1633 he
was tried by the Inquisition, found “vehemently suspect of heresy”,
forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.

## The Assayer

The Assayer was written in 1623 as a defense of Galileo’s scientific and
philosophical views against Jesuit criticism. Specifically, it was
written in response to Jesuit professor Orazio Grassi, whose
*Astronomical Balance* of 1619 criticized various aspects of Galileo’s
views concerning astronomy and physics. It particularly pleased the new
pope, Urban VIII, to whom it had been dedicated. Galileo’s dispute with
Grassi permanently alienated many of the Jesuits who had previously been
sympathetic to his ideas, and Galileo and his friends were convinced
that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later
condemnation, though the evidence for this is not conclusive (cf.
@blackwell1991; @blackwell2008).

To “assay” is to examine something in order to assess its nature,
particularly in respect to testing a metal or ore in order to determine
its quality or worth. So the title of Galileo’s works references the
idea of examination of worth in its own examination of the physical and
astronomical doctrines put forward by Grassi.

### Galileo’s Scientific Rationalism & the Conceivability Argument

Galileo argues that we should distinguish between two different classes
of feature which a material body might have, and that only one of these
classes is relevant to providing explanations of the nature and behavior
of physical phenomena.

> Now I say that whenever I conceive any material or corporeal
> substance, I immediately feel the need to think of it as bounded, and
> as having this or that shape…[etc.]…From these conditions I cannot
> separate such a substance by any stretch of my imagination. But that
> it must be white or red, bitter or sweet, noisy or silent, and of
> sweet or foul odor, my mind does not feel compelled to bring in as
> necessary accompaniments. Without the senses as our guides, reason or
> imagination unaided would probably never arrive at qualities like
> these. Hence I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more
> than mere names so far as the object in which we place them is
> concerned, and that they reside only in the consciousness (Galileo,
> p. 274).

We might formalize his argument as follows:

1.  Thinking of a material object requires thinking of it as having a
    particular set of qualities (i.e. size, shape, location, motion,
    etc.)
2.  Thinking of a material object does not require thinking of it as
    having specific sensory qualities (e.g. color, taste, smell, sound)
3.  The only qualities possessed by a material object are those which we
    must attribute to it in thought
4.  $\therefore$ Sensory qualities are not qualities of material
    objects, but rather features of our consciousness of those objects —
    i.e. “sensations” [from 2, 3]
5.  $\therefore$ If there were no conscious beings there would be no
    sensory qualities (e.g. colors, tastes, smells, etc.). [from 4]

Galileo thus argues from the conceivable separation of the geometric
qualities of objects from the proper sensibles such as color and smell,
to the fundamentality of the geometric qualities and the ultimate
unreality (or subject-dependence) of the purely sensory qualities.

Central to this argument is the assumption which lies behind premise
(3), that the only qualities we need attribute to a material being are
those which we must attribute to it in thought. This assumes what we can
call ‘*modal rationalism*’,

Modal Rationalism:
:   The actual, possible, and necessary features of reality may be
    determined by examining the actual, possible, and necessary features of the
    concepts and conceptual relations by which we think about reality

This view should be familiar from reading Descartes. Descartes also
thought that we could move from claims about dependence and distinctness
relations concerning our thoughts (e.g. that our thoughts of material
body depend, one and all, on our thought of extension) to dependence or
distinctions about things in the mind-independent world (e.g. that all
the properties of a material substance depend, as its modes, on
extension). This assumption lies behind his ‘real distinction’ argument
concerning the independence of mental substance from the existence of
any body. Descartes, of course, attempts to justify his modal
rationalism in the *Meditations* by appealing to the existence and
veracity of God. Galileo, in contrast, provides no such epistemological
ground for his assumption.

# Locke on Ideas & Qualities

In the *Essay* Locke, in a way similar to that of Galileo and Descartes,
distinguishes between our idea of a thing and the features or
‘qualities’ of the thing itself.

> Whatever the mind perceives in itself—whatever is the immediate object
> of perception, thought, or understanding—I call an idea; and the power
> to produce an idea in our mind I call a quality of the thing that has
> that power (E II.viii.8)

So, qualities are in objects, and they are powers to produce minds in
us. Locke thus seems to distinguish between things that depend on
*us*—ideas in minds, and things that depend on *objects*—powers to to
cause those ideas. Moreover, Locke sometimes distinguishes between the
‘active’ and ‘passive’ powers of an object. Active powers are those
powers of a substance to causally affect other substances—fire has the
active power to melt gold. Passive powers are those powers of a
substance *to be causally affected by others*—gold has the passive power
to be melted by fire. It is tempting, and perhaps correct, to read Locke
here as using the term ‘power’ to describe the modal features of an
object—what it is possible (perhaps *physically* possible) for the
object to affect and be affected by.

## Locke’s Adaptation of the Primary/Secondary Distinction

Locke thinks that the kinds of qualities in objects may divided into two
classes—primary and secondary.

> Qualities thus considered in bodies are, First, such as are utterly
> inseparable from the body, in what state soever it be; and such as in
> all the alterations and changes it suffers, all the force can be used
> upon it, it constantly keeps; and such as sense constantly finds in
> every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and
> the mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less
> than to make itself singly be perceived by our senses: v.g. Take a
> grain of wheat, divide it into two parts; each part has still
> solidity, extension, figure, and mobility: divide it again, and it
> retains still the same qualities; and so divide it on, till the parts
> become insensible; they must retain still each of them all those
> qualities (II.viii.9).

Primary qualities are, for Locke, the geometric/kinetic features of
substances—their shape, size, motion, and solidity. These qualities are
in bodies independently of our perception of them, and cannot be altered
(at least as *determinables*) or removed from bodies.

> Secondly, [there are qualities] which in truth are nothing in the
> objects themselves but powers to produce various sensations in us by
> their primary qualities, i.e. by the bulk, figure, texture, and motion
> of their insensible parts, as colours, sounds, tastes, &c. These I
> call secondary qualities (II.viii.10, 14, 23).

Next, there are the *secondary* qualities, which are explanatorily less
significant, and are ‘nothing in the objects themselves but powers’.
Hence there is some indication here that we have a contrast in the sense
in which primary as opposed to secondary qualities are *real*. Primary
qualities are *really in* bodies, while secondary qualities are *mere
powers* to produce ideas in us. This way of putting the distinction
suggests something like Galileo’s conclusion, that the secondary
qualities are merely subjective. But it also raises problems.

### Problems

Locke initially introduces the notion of a quality in terms of a power
to produce ideas. But his definition of a secondary quality is in terms
of it being ‘nothing in the object itself’ but a power to produce ideas.
But primary qualities are also qualities, and thus powers to produce
ideas. So where are supposed to get a *distinction* between them? We
seem to get something like the following argument (see @rickless1997 for
discussion):

1.  Shape is a primary quality
2.  If shape is a primary quality then it is a quality
3.  Qualities are powers to produce ideas
4.  ∴ Shape is a power to produce an idea—presumably the idea of shape
5.  But secondary qualities are also powers to produce ideas
6.  ∴ There is no primary/secondary distinction between qualities

This is certainly not the conclusion Locke wants us to draw. We appear
to have several options.

A.  Deny that primary qualities are “qualities” in Locke’s
    sense—i.e. deny that there are powers
B.  Agree that primary qualities are powers but deny that they are the
    same sort of power as with secondary qualities
C.  Posit that Locke uses “quality” in two different senses:
    -   Quality~1~: X is a quality~1~ iff X is a property
    -   Quality~2~: X is a quality~2~ iff X is a power to cause an idea
        in one’s mind

D.  Maintain that there is only one sense to “quality” but distinguish
    between real qualities and mere qualities
    -   “Real” qualities are qualities which are more than mere powers
        in things, and exist even in the absence of things they affect
    -   “Mere” qualities are no more than powers in things and cease to
        exist the things they affect are absent

There is a fair bit of textual evidence for (D).

> The particular Bulk, Number, Figure, and Motion of the parts of Fire,
> or Snow, are really in them, whether any ones Senses perceive them or
> no: and therefore they may be called real Qualities, because they
> really exist in those Bodies (II.viii.17)

> The Idea of Heat, or Light, which we receive by our Eyes, or touch
> from the Sun, are commonly thought real Qualities, existing in the
> Sun, and something more than mere Powers in it (II.viii.24)

> Were there no fit Organs to receive the impressions Fire makes on the
> Sight and Touch; nor a Mind joined to those Organs to receive the
> Ideas of Light and Heat, by those impressions from the Fire, or the
> Sun, there would yet be no more Light, or Heat in the World, than

> higher than ever it did (II.xxxi.2)

> Let us consider the red and white colours in porphyry. Hinder light

> alterations are made in the porphyry by the presence or absence of
> light; and that those ideas of whiteness and redness are really in
> porphyry in the light, when it obviously has no colour in the
> dark?(II.viii.19)

In these passages Locke seems to come extremely close to the Galilean
position that all secondary qualities are merely subjective, while
primary qualities are *real* — that is, they really exist in substances
independent of the existence of any perceiver.

Another way putting this is that the real or primary qualities of an
object are *intrinsic* to it. That is, they are had by it independent of
any relation that it might have to other things. “Mere” qualities, in
contrast, are *relational*; they depend for their existence in part on
the existence and nature of something other than the objects whose
qualities they are. Locke indicates this in several places.

> the greatest part of the ideas that make our complex idea of gold are
> yellowness, great weight, ductility, fusibility…all which ideas are
> nothing else but so many relations to other substances; and are not
> really in the gold, considered barely in itself, though they depend on
> those real and primary qualities of its internal constitution
> (II.xxiii.37)

> Put a piece of gold anywhere by itself, separate from the reach and
> influence of all other bodies, it will immediately lose all its colour
> and weight, and perhaps malleableness too (IV.vi.11)

## Restating the Primary/Secondary Distinction

With these distinctions in hand we might restate the distinction between
primary and secondary qualities as follows.

Primary Qualities:
:   Qualities of bodies which are “really” in them in the sense of being
    both: (i) non-relational and (ii) of a determinable which must be
    had by any body (e.g. solidity, extension, size, shape)

Secondary Qualities:
:   Qualities of bodies, which are “merely” in them, and determined by
    their primary qualities to produce sensory ideas in perceiving
    subjects. These qualities are both (i) relational and (ii) of
    determinables which need not be had by every body (e.g. colors,
    sounds, tastes)

## The Arguments for the Primary/Secondary Distinction

Locke presents a number of different cases in which he thinks we clearly
see his primary/secondary distinction at work. Though it is not clear
whether he considers these cases to be *arguments* for the distinction,
or merely illustrative of it, I’ll be understanding them as arguments
(though perhaps very compressed ones). We’ll take them in turn.[^2]

### The Porphyry Case[^3] {#the-porphyry-case3}

> Let us consider the red and white colours in Porphyre: Hinder light
> but from striking on it, and its Colours Vanish; it no longer produces
> any such Ideas in us: Upon the return of Light, it produces these
> appearances on us again. Can any one think any real alterations are
> made in the Porphyre, by the presence or absence of Light; and that
> those Ideas of whiteness and redness, are really in Porphyre in the
> light, when ’tis plain it has no colour in the dark? (II.viii.19)

(1) In the dark, porphyry is neither red nor white.
(2) The real qualities possessed by porphyry in the dark are the same as
    the real qualities possessed by porphyry in the light.
(3) ∴ Redness and whiteness are not real qualities in porphyry, whether
    in the light or in the dark.

### The Almond Case

> Pound an Almond, and the clear white Colour will be altered into a
> dirty one, and the sweet Taste into an oily one. What real Alteration
> can the beating of the Pestle make in any Body, but an Alteration of
> the Texture of it?(II.viii.20)

(1) The pounding of an almond changes its color and taste.
(2) The only real quality in an almond that it is possible to change by
    pounding it is its texture.
(3) Neither the color nor the taste of an almond is identical to its
    texture.
(4) ∴ The color and taste of an almond are not real qualities in it.

### The Water Case

> Ideas being thus distinguished and understood, we may be able to give
> an Account, how the same Water, at the same time, may produce the Idea
> of Cold by one Hand, and of Heat by the other: Whereas it is
> impossible, that the same Water, if those Ideas were really in it,
> should at the same time be both Hot and Cold (II.viii.21)

(1) Water, at the same time, produces an idea of Heat when touched by
    one hand and produces an idea of Coldness when touched by the other
    hand.
(2) Water that produces an idea of Heat when touched by a hand has [the
    quality] Heat.
(3) Water that produces an idea of Coldness when touched by a hand has
    [the quality] Coldness.
(4) ∴ Water, at the same time, has Heat and Coldness. (From 1, 2, 3)
(5) Heat and Coldness are opposites.
(6) It is impossible for opposite real qualities to exist in the same
    substance at the same time.
(7) Heat is a real quality if and only if Coldness is a real quality.
(8) ∴ Heat and Coldness are not real qualities. (From 4, 5, 6, 7)
