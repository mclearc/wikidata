# The Structure of *Meditation* 2

There are two main claims made in *Meditation* 2. First, Descartes
argues, in the '*cogito'*, that the one thing he cannot be deceived of
is his own existence as a thinking thing. Second, Descartes argues that
he has a particular nature, and that he knows this nature better than
that of any body.

-   The review of doubt; the *Cogito* (7:24-5; M.3-4)
-   The nature of the 'I' as thinking thing (7:25-7; EMT M.4-5)
-   The mind's unknown relation to body (7:27; EMT M.5)
-   The mind itself is not 'imageable' (7:27-8; EMT M.5)
-   The variety and unity of thought (7:28-9; EMT M.5-6)
-   The 'Wax Argument' --- our knowledge of body (7:29-33; EMT M.6-7)
-   Analysis of the nature and content of perceptual judgment (7:32; EMT
    M.7-8)
-   The Mind is better known than (any) body (7:33-4; EMT M.8)

## An Archimedean Point

Descartes's method of doubt has forced him to give up nearly all his
beliefs. But he still holds out for the possibility that some belief is
certain.

> Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order
> to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I
> manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and
> unshakeable. (7:24; EMT M.4)

Why just one certain belief? One might reasonably wonder whether
anything could be gotten from having just one certain belief. Gary
Hatfield (@hatfield2003, 101) highlights three different answers to this
question --- (1) the 'foundationalist' answer: what is certain is a
'first principle' from which we derive other knowledge; (2) the
'systematicity' answer: what is certain is systematically connected with
other knowledge (e.g. knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4 might be systematically
related to knowledge that 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, etc.); (3) the 'methodological'
answer: what is certain reveal a method for deriving other certainties.

It is not clear which of these three answers Descartes has in mind in
his statement concerning an Archimedean point. So we'll simply have to
see how he develops his argument.

## The '*Cogito*'

Here is the crux of Descartes's argument:

> I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world,
> no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too
> do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly
> existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is
> deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too
> undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as
> much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long
> as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very
> thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, *I am, I
> exist*, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or
> conceived in my mind. (7:25; EMT M.4)

Thus, Descartes's 'Archimedean point' is the proposition 'I am thinking,
therefore I exist'. How should we understand this? We want to know at
least the following three things --- viz., (1) what is the conclusion of
the argument (i.e. what is it that is established)?; (2) how is the
conclusion established?; (3) what role does the conclusion play in
Descartes broader philosophical theory (i.e. can we use the *cogito* to
determine which of the three answers discussed above is the right one)?

To answer (1), Descartes appears to draw two conclusions from the
argument. The first is limited to the conclusion that the Meditator
exists. Granting that the subject of 'I' in the antecedent of the
conditional is thinking, then that same subject, according to the
conclusion, exists. Descartes also draws a more ambitious conclusion,
viz., that the nature of the subject is that of a thinking thing or
substance. In other words, the 'I' of 'I exist' is a particular sort of
thing, a thinking thing. This more ambitious conclusion is pursued by
Descartes throughout the rest of the *Meditation*.

Descartes seems correct to argue that from the fact that one is
thinking, one can conclude that one exists. But it is not clear that
this is all he needs for even his weaker conclusion. In fact, there are
two serious objections to just the weak conclusion of the argument, much
less the stronger version.

### Two Objections

First, we can ask what entitles Descartes (or the meditator) to the use
of the first-person pronoun in the premise of his argument? Doesn't the
use of 'I' in 'I am thinking' *presuppose* the existence of the subject?
Remember, the Meditator is here doubting his own existence. If knowledge
of one's own (as Meditator) existence is supposed to be the *conclusion*
of an argument or inference we cannot assume the conclusion in the
course of articulating the premises. To do so would be committing a
logical fallacy --- viz., *[begging the
question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question)* (cf.
@dicker2013).

In response we might reformulate Descartes's argument in a way [first
suggested](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum) by [Georg
Lichtenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg).
According to this formulation, instead of 'I am thinking, therefore I
exist' we should state the argument as 'There is thinking (or 'there is
a thought', therefore I exist'. The problem with this version of the
argument, however, is that it is invalid. There is no assurance that
from the mere existence of a thought it is oneself, *qua* Meditator,
that exists. All that may be concluded is that some thought exists, or
perhaps more strongly, that some thinking thing exists, but there is no
assurance that the very same think which thinks in the premise is the
thing which thinks in the conclusion (cf. @dicker2013, ch. 2;
@williams1978, ch. 3; @hatfield2003, 103-4). All we have is a train of
thoughts. Compare:

(T1) It is thought: *P* (T2) It is thought: *Q*

Does it follow from these that (T3) It is thought: P & Q ? It seems that
T3 cannot follow, unless we have some means for connecting T1 and T2.

In other words, there is an issue of the apparent separateness of the
thoughts expressed in Descartes's argument, to which the application of
'I' presupposes an answer that Descartes cannot use without begging the
question. So it seems that his supposed Archimedian point is in danger
of either begging the question or being invalid. Is there a way out?

#### The Substance Theory

One possible strategy, which Descartes at various points seems to take,
is to assume a particular metaphysics regarding our understanding of the
nature of an individual object and its properties. Call this the
'*Substance Theory*'. According to the Substance Theory, all things are
composed of various properties as well as an underlying 'substance'
which has them. This is in contrast to what is typically called a
'*Bundle Theory*', according to which things are nothing more than
bundles, collections, or aggregates of properties. One of the reasons to
favor the Substance Theory over the Bundle Theory has to do with the
issue of generation and change. Intuitively, there is a difference
between a thing's coming into being (generation) and that thing's
changing some of its properties (qualitative change). But if there is
such a distinction then there must, in addition to the properties or
qualities of a thing, be some underlying thing which persists through
addition or subtraction of properties (i.e. qualitative change). On the
face of it the Bundle Theory cannot make this distinction, though there
is [significant debate](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/substance/)
about this.

Reformulated with the assumption of a substance ontology, Descartes's
*Cogito* might be rendered as follows (@dicker2013, 54-5).

1.  A thing is composed of its properties or characteristics *plus* an
    underlying substance to which they belong
2.  If there is a property or characteristic, then there must be a
    substance to which it belongs.
3.  A thought is a property.
4.  If there is a thought, then there is a substance to which it
    belongs.
5.  There is a thought.
6.  $\therefore$ There is a substance to which this thought belongs:
    "I".

One key premise here is (2), sometimes called the 'substance-property
principle', which rules out the existence of properties that do not
'belong' to any substance. Descartes endorses this principle in a
variety of his work (O&R 7:222; Pr 8A:8, 25). The other premises are
either plausibly or explicitly endorsed by him as well. What's more, we
have avoided stating the argument in a question begging way. So the
question is whether the conclusion follows.

Unfortunately for Descartes, it is not obvious that it does. There
remains the question of what allows us to call the existence of the
thinking substance 'I'. Hence, even the reconstruction seems to remain
invalid, insofar as it attempts to prove from the existence of thought
that oneself, *qua* Meditator, exists as the thinker of that thought.
So, while it is true that from that 'I am thinking' one may legitimately
infer 'I exist', Descartes needs something stronger---viz., from 'there
is thinking' that 'I exist', and this cannot be done, it seems by the
argument he provides.

### Inference or Intuition?

There is a further question concerning the nature of the apparent
inference from 'I am thinking' to 'I exist'. Is it correct to consider
this an inference, which might be put in premise-conclusion form. Or is
it rather that Descartes intends us to read the claim as something
grasped 'intuitively' and without recourse to argument? Remember that
Descartes intends the *Cogito* to be his Archimedian point, so we would
like to know how the *Cogito* relates to Descartes's foundationalism. Is
the *Cogito* a bit of *inferential* knowledge, or is it non-inferential?

Descartes interestingly thinks that the answer is 'both' (9A:206).
First, he seems to think that our grasp of the *Cogito* is intuitive ---
we come to see its conclusion 'all at once'. So the Meditator does not
derive it by means of any explicit argument, such as via syllogism. But,
Descartes concedes, the structure of the *Cogito* is inferentially
complex, so that in reflecting on what is known via the *Cogito* one is
led to articulate distinct premises from which the conclusion 'I exist'
ultimately follows (@hatfield2003, 112).

### The Aim of the *Cogito*

Even if we grant that the *Cogito* grounds the Meditator's certainty of
his own existence, this doesn't seem to provide Descartes with what he
wants --- viz., a first principle from which the rest of his
philosophical system is derived, in any of the three senses
(foundational, systematic, methodological) discussed above. We'll have
to revisit this question as Descartes's argument in the *Meditations*
unfolds.

## The Nature of the 'I' as Subject

Recall that the *Cogito* aimed to derive two conclusions, a weak and a
strong. We've seen that there are problems with the weak conclusion, but
what of the strong? The Meditator claims to know not only that he
exists, but that he is a particular kind of thing --- a thinking thing.

> At present I am not admitting anything except what is necessarily
> true. I am, then, in the strict sense only a thing that thinks; that
> is, I am a mind, or intelligence, or intellect, or reason --- words
> whose meaning I have been ignorant of until now. But for all that I am
> a thing which is real and which truly exists. But what kind of a
> thing? As I have just said --- a thinking thing. [7:27]

The Meditator draws this conclusion based on the fact that, as far as he
knows, he has no body (remember the evil demon) nor any connection to a
material world. This doesn't yet show that the existence of his mind (or
minds generally) may be had independent of any material object, but it
does show (according to Descartes) that the mind is intelligible
independently of any body. This might also explain why Descartes/the
Meditator says that his is 'ignorant' of the meanings of the words
'mind, intellect, or reason' until he has gone through this method of
doubt. Prior to this meditation he might have thought that the
intelligibility of something's being a mind or intellect was importantly
connected to its being a body.

Descartes further understands the 'I' in terms of the kinds of activity
it can undertake. A thinking thing is "a thing that doubts, understands,
affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines and has
sensory perceptions” (7:28). Here we see a reference to sensory
experience, which might formerly have been associated with having a
body, but now is understood merely in terms of what are, presumably,
conscious experiences. This might also give us some hint as to what
unifies such a collection of activities. They are, one and all, kinds of
activity which are available to consciousness. We cannot yet say whether
Descaertes/the Meditator intend to equate thinking with consciousness,
or even to consider it essential. But it does provide a unifying
characteristic to what is otherwise a motley collection.

For example, Descartes makes light of the issue of the 'ownership' of
the various activities. He says,

> Is it not one and the same “I” who is now doubting almost everything,
> who nonetheless understands some things, who affirms that this one
> thing is true, denies everything else, desires to know more, is
> unwilling to be deceived, imagines many things even involuntarily, and
> notices many things as apparently coming from the senses? (7:28-9)

One reason why he might make light of the question whether there is one
and the same 'I' aware of all these activities is that they are all
available to consciousness is roughly the same unmediated manner.

## The Wax Argument & Knowledge of Body ## {wax-argument}

Descartes considers an objection to his argument thus far, viz., that
perhaps one may still think that material bodies are better and more
clearly known than the mind. After all, the Meditator's reflections thus
far have been very abstract, and the knowledge of the mind fairly
limited, specifically to the kinds of activities of which it is capable
(and it isn't even clear what binds this list of activities together or
if the list is even complete).

So, asks the Meditator, what is it that is supposedly so clearly known
about body? The example of the wax aims to show at least two things.
First, that our grasp of the wax as a particular kind of material body
depends fundamentally on the *intellect* rather than the senses. Second,
our understanding of the wax as a material body is ultimately just as
abstract as our grasp of ourselves as thinking beings, hence our
cognitive grasp of material body has no real advantage over that of the
mind.

So what is it that is so clearly understood about body, specifically,
the piece of wax the Meditator contemplates? Descartes's first aim is to
show that the fact that we can have a sensory 'image' of the wax via our
various sense modalities does not tell us anything clearly about the
*wax*. All it does is present us with a specific array of determinate
qualities, all of which change or can change under various
circumstances. However, as the Meditator notes, despite changes of
quality we understand something as persisting, viz., the wax itself. So
what is this persisting thing, and whence comes our cognitive grasp of
it if it is not any particular sensory quality grasped via the senses?

Descartes/the Meditator argues that the wax is *extendible*, *flexible*,
and *changeable*.

> But what is meant here by “flexible” and “changeable”? Is it what I
> picture in my imagination: that this piece of wax is capable of
> changing from a round shape to a square shape, or from a square shape
> to a triangular shape? Not at all: for I can grasp that the wax is
> capable of countless changes of this kind, yet I am unable to run
> through this immeasurable number of changes in my imagination, from
> which it follows that it is not the faculty of imagination that gives
> me my grasp of the wax as flexible and changeable. (7:31; EMT M.7)

Here we have a kind of argument from elimination. We know, the Meditator
argues, that the wax is fleixble and changeable, but we know this not
via any sensory 'image'. Instead we seem to grasp it independently, via
the intellect alone. Gary Hatfield reconstructs the argument as follows
(@hatfield2003, 130-1).

1.  I can grasp that this melted wax is flexible and changeable so as to
    be capable of innumerable changes of shape.
2.  Imagination could allow me to grasp this fact only by representing
    these changes by an image of each possible shape.
3.  My imagination cannot represent the innumerable shapes required.
4.  It is not the imagination that allows me to grasp this capability of
    the wax.
5.  But I do grasp this capability, so it must be by a faculty other
    than (sense or) imagination: call it the mind itself.

So, according to the Meditator/Descartes, the nature of the wax as
extended, flexible, and changable (i.e. as a body persisting through
qualitative change) is ultimately known via the *intellect* and not via
the *senses* (or the imagination).

This argument also makes clear why the Meditator might reasonably claim
that our cognitive grasp of body is no less abstract than our grasp of
ourselves as thinking things. What's more, according to the Meditator,
since our cognitive grasp of body is ultimately via thought, and we are
acquainted with our thoughts more intimately than with any body (as the
method of doubt was supposed to show), we actually know our nature as
thinking beings better than any body.

> What, I ask, is this 'I' which seems to perceive the wax so
> distinctly? Surely my awareness of my own self is not merely much
> truer and more certain than my awareness of the wax, but also much
> more distinct and evident, For if I judge that the wax exists from the
> fact that I see it, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently
> that I myself also exist. It is possible that what I see is nor really
> the wax; it is possible that I do not even have eyes with which to see
> anything. But when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing
> the two), it is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not
> something. By the same token, if I judge that the wax exists from the
> fact that I touch it, the same result follows, namely that I exist. If
> I judge that it exists from the fact that I imagine it, or for any
> other reason, exactly the same thing follows, And the result that I
> have grasped in the case of the wax may be applied to everything else
> located outside me. (7:33; EMT M.7-8)

Thus, the pure intellect is set up, contrary to Aristotelianism, as the
fundamental organ of human cognition, and as one whose nature can be
known via pure reflection.
