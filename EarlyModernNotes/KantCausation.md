# The Problem with A Priori Concepts

Kant’s mature philosophical system is notable for the strictures it sets
on the kind of knowledge human beings (or finite rational beings more
generally) can achieve through reason alone. Importantly, Kant thinks
that pure reason may achieve relatively little on its own. All of our
ampliative knowledge that is also necessary and universal consists in
what Kant calls ‘synthetic a priori’ judgments or propositions. The
central question he then pursues concerns how knowledge of such
synthetic a priori propositions is possible. [We previously
discussed](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mclearc/ModernPhilosophyNotes/blob/master/KantSpace.html)
Kant’s arguments concerning the role (the representations of) space and
time play in grounding necessary and universal mathematical knowledge.
Thus, mathematical knowledge is synthetic because it goes beyond mere
conceptual analysis to deal with the structure of (our representation
of) space itself. It is a priori because the structure of (our
representation of) space is a priori accessible to us, being merely the
form of our intuition and not a real mind independent thing (a ‘thing in
itself’).

However, in addition to the representation of space and time, Kant also
thinks that possession of a particular privileged set of a priori
concepts is necessary for knowledge of the empirical world. But this
raises a problem. How could an a priori concept, which is not itself
derived from any particular experience, be nevertheless legitimately
applicable to objects of experience? To make things even more difficult,
it is not the mere possibility of the application of a priori concepts
to objects of experience that worries Kant, for this could just be a
matter of pure luck. Kant wants even more than mere possibility, for he
wants to show that with regard to a privileged set of a priori concepts,
they apply necessarily and universally to all objects of experience and
do so in a way that we are in a position to know a priori.

Kant’s strategy for demonstrating how this is possible hinges on showing
that the experience of objects which he thinks all would agree that we
have nevertheless depends on the application of such a priori concepts.
Kant makes this clear in his elaboration of his ‘Copernican Turn’ in
philosophy:

> Any beliefs I reach about what an object is like will involve me in
> using concepts of it—·if I come to think that something is solid, say,
> I’ll have to bring my concept of solidity to bear on it·. Now there
> are two ways in which my concepts might fit the objects of my
> inquiries. One is this: •My concepts, which I employ in my beliefs
> about what the object is like, conform to the objects. If that is
> right, though, I am back in my old difficulty, namely that it seems
> impossible for me to know anything a priori about the object. The
> second alternative is this: •The objects conform to my concepts,
> or—the same thing in different words–•The experience in which the
> objects are known conforms to my concepts. ·The focus on experience is
> legitimate, because· it is only in experience that the objects can be
> known as things that are given. This second alternative offers a gleam
> of hope: experience is a kind of knowledge in which the understanding
> must be involved (Bxvii; EMT 10)

Kant’s strategy is thus to show how a priori concepts legitimately apply
to their objects in virtue of being partly constitutive of the objects
of representation, rather than the traditional view in which the objects
of representation were the ground of our concepts. Now, what exactly
this means is deeply contested, as it is rather unclear what Kant
intends us to understand by his Transcendental Idealism. For example,
does Kant intend that the objects of representation are *themselves*
nothing other than representations? This would be a form of
phenomenalism similar to that offered by Berkeley. Kant, however, seems
to want to deny that his view is similar to Berkeley’s, asserting
instead that the objects of representation really exist independently of
the mind, and that it is only the *way* that they are represented that
is mind-dependent.

> (*Prolegomena*, EMT 24)

I’m mostly going to set this issue to the side in what follows. But it
is important to consider, insofar as Kant takes himself to be replying
to Hume’s arguments about the nature of the empirical world and the
nature and extent of our knowledge of it.

# A Transcendental Deduction

In order to prove that there are a priori concepts which legitimately
apply to the objects of experience, Kant articulates [a special sort of
argument](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/) which
he calls a ‘transcendental deduction’. As @henrich1989 points out, the
notion of a ‘deduction’ that Kant uses, is a legal one intended to
provide a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property
claim. In Kant’s case however, it is transformed into a justification of
the applicability (in the sense discussed above) of the a priori
concepts which Kant calls the ‘categories’. These are the concepts given
in Kant’s ‘Table of Categories’ (A80/B106; EMT 52); they are Unity,
Plurality, and Totality (the Categories of Quantity); Reality, Negation,
and Limitation (the Categories of Quality); Inherence and Subsistence,
Causality and Dependence, and Community (the Categories of Relation),
and Possibility-Impossibility, Existence-Nonexistence,
Necessity-Contingency (the Categories of Modality).[^1]

With regard to each category, Kant’s aim is to show that it has
‘objective validity’—i.e. legitimate application to the objects of
experience. Disputes concerning various membsers of the table should be
familiar. Hume famously disputes the legitimacy of our concept *cause*.
Hume thinks (in Kant’s terms) that no ‘empirical deduction’ of the
concept is possible—i.e. that the concept cannot be traced to the
occurrence of a corresponding impression. Kant concurs with Hume on this
point, but argues that this doesn’t show that the concept is
illegitimate, for it be both a priori and legitimately applied in virtue
of being a necessary condition for experience to occur.

For Kant then a ‘transcendental deduction’ starts from a premise
concerning some feature of human experience, a premise which reasonable
interlocutors might be expected to endorse, and then argues to a
substantive philosophical conclusion concerning the presuppositions or
necessary conditions of the truth of that premise. Since Kant’s concern
here is the a priori categories, his aim is to show that a
presupposition or necessary condition of some relatively uncontroversial
feature of experience is the applicability of the a priori concept(s) in
question to the objects of experience. Below we’ll concern ourselves
with Kant’s answer to Hume regarding the objective legtimacy of the
concept *cause*.

# The Second Analogy

Kant discusses the category of *cause* in the second of his three
‘Analogies’. The Analogies are part of the ‘Analytic of Principles’ in
which Kant discusses each of the twelve categories and their relation to
the objects of experience at much greater length than he does in the
argument of the Transcendental Deduction, where he is concerned with the
categories general relation to <object></object>cts of experience.

Kant aims to prove the truth of a particular principle or general rule
in the second Analogy. He states this as follows:

> All alterations take place in conformity with the law of the
> connection of cause and effect (EMT 111)

There are some important lacunae with respect to Kant’s statement of the
principle. First, Kant’s principle does not apply to all events, but
only to those which we might be able to *experience*. Hence its scope is
restricted to empirical events, and it is an open question whether the
set of all empirical events exhausts the set of possible events.
However, even this limited version of the causal principle is enough to
argue against Hume, who denied that we have any knowledge of the cause
(understood as necessary connection) of any event.

Second, Hume supposes that any idea (or concept) of *cause* will involve
its being copied or otherwise generated from one or more impressions.
Kant supposes no such thing. Instead, Kant argues that the experience of
causation *presupposes* the application in experience of the concept
*cause*. This partly is why Kant considers his argument for the
legitimacy of the concept to be a ‘transcendental’ as opposed to a
merely ‘empirical’ deduction of the concept.

## The Argument

Above I defined a transcendental argument as one which starts from
premises which no reasonable interlocutor would deny. Given that Kant’s
aim is to argue against Hume, we must ask whether Kant starts from a
premise concerning causation which Hume would grant. As Lewis White Beck
effectively argued, Kant does indeed agree with Hume’s thesis that all
our knowledge of causal connections proceeds via induction, that is, we
come to know that A causes B (or A-type events cause B-type events) by
observing the constant conjunction of A and B in our experience. Now, a
presupposition of observing the constant conjunction of A and B is that
we perceive a temporal succession of events. One event (A) comes
*before* another (B). This much must be assumed by Hume if his argument
about constant conjunction is to make sense. Kant’s ingenious move is to
argue that Hume’s assumption of an awareness of temporal succession
presupposes a grasp of the difference between the subjective order of
our perceptual states and the objective temporal order of the events or
objects we perceive. Kant illustrates this by way of an example
involving a ship moving downstream.

> in an appearance that contains a happening in which state A of the
> perception is followed by state B, B *can’t* be apprehended except as
> following A; the perception A *can’t* follow B but can only precede
> it. For example: I see a ship being sailed downstream. My perception
> of its lower position *follows* the perception of its position higher
> up in the river, and it *couldn’t* happen that in apprehending this
> appearance I first perceived the ship lower down and then afterwards
> higher up. In this case the order in which the perceptions occur in
> apprehension is fixed, and my apprehension has to stay with this
> order. (CPR B237; EMT 113)

Kant’s point here is that *given* an objective succession of events (the
ship’s moving down the river from point A to point B) our perceptions of
those events have to proceed in a particular order (cf. @watkins2005,
212). The order of one’s perceptions is thus parasitic on the objective
order of the events. Kant then asks us to consider the following
contrast case.

> For instance, there is a house in front of me; I take in successively
> the various aspects of its appearance; but no-one will say that
> various aspects of the house are also successive…In the ‘house’
> example, my perceptions could begin with the apprehension of the roof
> and end with the basement, or could begin from below and end above;
> and ·in taking in the view of the house from a single position·, I
> could go from right to left or from left to right. Thus, in the series
> of these perceptions there was no determinate order making it
> *necessary* for me to start at some one point. But in the perception
> of an *event* there is always a rule that makes the order in which the
> perceptions (in the apprehension of this appearance) occur in a
> *necessary* order. (CPR B235, 237-8; EMT 112, 113)

Kant’s point here is that, in contrast to the ship case, the subjective
order of our perceptions is not made necessary (or better, does not
track) an objective succession of events. Since the house is a
persisting object, our subjective apprehension of it could come in any
of a variety of orderings, including an ordering that is simply the
reverse of that in which we actually perceived the house. This raises a
problem. A subjective succession of experiences is necessary, but not
sufficient, for an awareness of an objective temporal order to what one
experiences. So how do we get from the one to the other? Put another
way, we distinguish the representation of a persisting object, such as a
house, from a series of events, such as a ship moving downriver. But in
both cases there is no difference subjectively in what occurs, viz. a
succession of subjective perceptual experiences. So how is it that we
can distinguish in the ship case that we have an objective succession of
events, while in the house case we have one persisting object, whose
parts (e.g. roof, walls, windows, etc.) we could perceive in any of a
variety of orderings?

Kant rules out several possibilities. We can’t distinguish objective
succession from objective simultaneity by perception of any necessary
connection because (and here Kant agrees with Hume) experience “to be
sure tells us what is, but not that it must necessarily be so and not
otherwise” (A 1). Second, the supposed irreversibility of our perception
of successive events cannot tell us anything because one can only be
aware of the necessary contrast between ‘reversible’ and ‘irreversible’
perceptions if one is *already* aware that there is an irreversible
order (e.g. B’s following A) to what one is perceiving, such that one’s
perceptions must be in accord with it. Third, one cannot appeal to some
independently perceivable temporal succession (‘absolute’ time), because
Kant has already ruled out the possibility of perceiving time itself (B
245; EMT 115). Fourth, one cannot appeal to the perception of any
mind-independent object (a ‘thing in itself’), since these too have been
ruled out as wholly inaccessible to our conscious awareness.

So Kant has issued a challenge: granted that a subject of experience has
a grasp of the distinction between objective succession of events (the
occurrence of events of type A followed by events of type B) and the
objective simultaneity of the features of an object (e.g. the various
features of a house), what account for such awareness? The Humean must
grant that we make such a distinction, for the Humean argument against
our understanding causation as necessary connection presupposes that we
can distinguish the objective sequence of events from our subjective
train of sense experiences.

Kant’s claim then, is that it is only if there is a rule ordering our representations, such that what makes it possible for us to grasp two events as related by objective temporal succession is that one event *caused* the other. Here is a reconstruction of the whole argument, as articulated by Georges Dicker (@dicker2004, 173).

1. We cannot know by observation that an event—that is, a transition from a state A to a state B—is occurring by knowing that the perceptions of A and B occur in the order A, B; by knowing that the perceptions of A and B are irreversible; by knowing that A precedes B by reference to absolute time; or by knowing that these perceptions are of successive states of things-in-them- selves.
2. If (1), then the only way we can know by perception that an event—that is, a transition from a state A to a state B—is occurring is by knowing that B follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause.
3. If the only way we can know by perception that an event—that is, a transi- tion from a state A to a state B—is occurring is by knowing that B follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause, then any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must have a cause.
4. $\therefore$ Any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must have a cause.

Kant's conclusion here is limited in several ways. First, it concerns only knowledge that empirical events have causes. Second, it presupposes that we have knowledge of the objective succession of events. Thirds, it presupposes that we correctly grasp the distinction between objective succession and objective simultaneity. But, despite these presuppositions, the argument seems an effective answer to the Humean, for the Humean analysis of causation requires that we have a grasp of objective succession, for this is used to explain how our associative powers get their grip on causal judgment. Hence, while Kant's argument concerning causation may not be effective against all comers, particularly against the skeptic who might deny that we have any cognitive grasp of objective succession, it nevertheless seems effective against Hume's argument.
