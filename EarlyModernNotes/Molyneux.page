title: 'Molyneux’s Question'
...

[Molyneux’s
question](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/molyneux-problem/) concerned
the relationship between tactile and visual sensations in the perception
of shape and distance. It was a sort of litmus test for many 17th and
18th century theories of perception.

# Phrasing Molyneux’s Question

The initial statement of the problem by William Molyneux in 1688:

> A Man, being born blind, and having a Globe and a Cube, nigh of the
> same bignes, Committed into his Hands, and being taught or Told, which
> is Called the Globe, and which the Cube, so as easily to distinguish
> them by his Touch or Feeling; Then both being taken from Him, and Laid
> on a Table, Let us Suppose his Sight Restored to Him; Whether he
> Could, by his Sight, and before he touch them, know which is the Globe
> and which the Cube? Or Whether he Could know by his Sight, before he
> stretch’d out his Hand, whether he Could not Reach them, tho they were
> Removed 20 or 1000 feet from Him?

> If the Learned and Ingenious Author of the Forementiond Treatise think
> this Problem Worth his Consideration and Answer, He may at any time
> Direct it to One that Much Esteems him, and is,

> His Humble Servant William Molyneux High Ormonds Gate in Dublin.
> Ireland

This was revised in the subsequent publication of the question in the
second edition of Locke’s *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*
(1694)

> Suppose a Man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to
> distinguish between a Cube, and a Sphere of the same metal, and nighly
> of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and t’other;
> which is the Cube, which the Sphere. Suppose then the Cube and Sphere
> placed on a Table, and the Blind Man to be made to see. Qaere, Whether
> by his sight, before he touch’d them, he could now distinguish, and
> tell, which is the Globe, which the Cube. (EHU II.IX.8)

In the second version we see that Molyneux no longer enquires as to
whether *distance* could be known by sight, for Molyneux’s own
experimental investigations had convinced him that distance was not
directly perceived but was rather the result of an act of judgment. This
idea would later be developed by Berkeley to great effect.

Locke’s question concerned whether a newly-sighted subject could
visually distinguish a sphere from a cube, and report or otherwise
articulate the visual perception of that difference. Locke answered this
question in the negative.

> I agree with this thinking Gentleman, whom I am proud to call my
> Friend, in his answer to this Problem; and am of opinion that the
> Blind Man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say
> which was the Globe, which the Cube, whilst he only saw them; though
> he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish
> them by the difference of their Figures felt.

It seems compatible with Locke’s stated position that the subject could
detect *some difference or other* between the two shapes, even if, as
Locke says, she could not name that difference or otherwise have
confidence that she knew one from the other.

# The Cheselden Experiments

In 1728, [William
Cheselden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cheselden) published
what would become, in the words of the historian Nicholas Pastore “the
most celebrated case study in the history of science until the early
case studies of Freud came along at the beginning of the twentieth
century” (@pastore1971, 99). This [influential
report](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/molyneux-problem/#3) concerned
a patient of Cheselden’s, blind from an early age, whose sight at the
age of thirteen was largely restored via surgery removing his cataracts.
Though Cheselden did not have any knowledge of Molyneux’s question or
Locke’s discussion of it, his observations led many to believe that the
empirical evidence best supported a negative answer to Molyneux’s
question.

> When he first saw, he was so far from making any Judgment about
> Distances, that he thought all Objects whatever touch’d his Eyes, (as
> he express’d it) as what he felt, did his Skin…He knew not the Shape
> of any Thing, nor any one Thing from another, however different in
> Shape or Magnitude; but upon being told what Things were, whose Form
> he before knew from feeling, he would carefully observe, that he might
> know them again…Having often forgot which was the Cat, and which the
> Dog, he was ashame’d to ask; but catching the Cat (which he knew by
> feeling) he was observe’d to look at her stedfastly, and then setting
> her down, said, So Puss! I shall know you another Time. (Cheselden,
> 1728)

Cheselden’s surgery was taken by many to confirm Locke and Berkeley’s
negative answers to Molyneux’s question. A newly sighted person cannot
visually distinguish a cube from a sphere, nor can they discern
distance. However, the ‘evidence’ was also contested. We’ll look at
Leibniz’s discussion in particular.

# Leibniz on Molyneux’s Question

Leibniz believes that a purely negative answer to Molyneux is incorrect.
Provided certain conditions obtain, Leibniz argues, the subject *should*
be able to distinguish between the sphere and the cube.

> If you will just consider my reply, you will see that I have included
> in it a condition:. . . .namely •that the blind man has been told that
> the two shaped bodies that are before him are a cube and a sphere, and
> •that he merely has the problem of telling which is which. Given this
> condition, it seems to me beyond question that the newly sighted man
> could discern them by applying rational principles to the sensory
> knowledge that he has already acquired by touch. (I’m not talking
> about what he might actually do on the spot, when he is dazzled and
> confused by the strangeness—or, one should add, unaccustomed to making
> inferences.) (II.ix.51)

Note that Leibniz here actually provides two provisos on his positive
answer. The first is that the blind subject be prompted with the
information that there are two differently shaped bodies before him—a
globe and a cube. Leibniz believes that a fairly straightforward line of
reasoning should allow the blind subject to deduce which is a sphere and
which a cube.

> My view rests on the fact that in the case of the sphere there are no
> distinguished points on the surface of the sphere taken in itself,
> since everything there is uniform and without angles, whereas in the
> case of the cube there are eight points that are distinguished from
> all the others. If there weren’t that way of recognising shapes, a
> blind man couldn’t learn the rudiments of geometry by touch, nor could
> a sighted person learn them by sight without touch. (II.ix.51)

Note that Leibniz’s position turns on the fact that the visual look to a
sphere discloses the fact that its surface is ‘uniform and without
angles’ and that the look of the cube is one which tells the subject
that ‘there are eight points [on its surface] that are distinguished
from all others’. Leibniz thus assumes that the way these objects look
is not something that itself need be learned, otherwise he thinks that
the subject would be unable to distinguish one from the other.

Leibniz's second proviso is that the subject may be unable to distinguish the two shapes merely because of physical/physiological problems having to do with the trauma of surgery or atrophy of the relevant sense organ. We now know that the development of the visual system involves periods of particular sensitivity to the presence or deprivation of light (@degenaar1996, 119; @chow1957). So, depending on when the subject first acquired their cataracts, there may be severe developmental problems in their capacity to cognitively process visual information. This makes it difficult to assess much of the supposed empirical evidence for or against a positive answer to Molyneux's question. 

# Berkeley’s Claim of Heterogeneity

An issue raised by Molyneux’s question concerns what Berekeley in his *New
Theory of Vision* would call the “heterogenity” of our visual and tactile
sensations. Berkeley argues in the *New Theory of Vision* that the objects and
properties sensed via the differing sense modalities are *different*. Hence
there is no one thing which is both seen and touched.

> it be certain, a man no more sees or feels the same thing, than he
> hears and feels the same thing (§47). if we take a close and accurate
> view of things, it must be acknowledged that we never see and feel one
> and the same object. That which is seen is one thing, and that which
> is felt is another; if the visible figure and extension be not the
> same with the tangible figure and extension, we are not to infer that
> one and the same thing has divers extensions. The true consequence is,
> that the objects of sight and touch are two distinct things (§49).

The “things” which Berkeley is concerned with here are the immediate
objects of sense—viz. the proper sensibles associated with each sense
modality—e.g., color for vision, sound for hearing, and texture for
touch. Berkeley thus argues that while we may commonly think that we
hear or see an object as far away, what we really do is hear a sound or
visually sense a colored array, which we then associate with tactile
cues which suggest distance. Hence there is no one thing, on Berkeley’s
view, which is sensed as being close or far away, or as visually square
and square to the touch.

This position yields an answer to Molyneux’s question similar to
that of Locke and Molyneux himself. The blind person could not in fact
visually identify a cube as a cube or a sphere as a sphere, even though
she could do so by touch alone. This conclusion is, Berkeley thinks,
most readily explained by the fact that the senses do not have common
objects.

> Now, if a square surface perceived by touch be of the same sort with a
> square surface perceived by sight; it is certain the blind man here
> mentioned might know a square surface, as soon as he saw it: it is no
> more but introduced into his mind, by a new inlet, an idea he has been
> already well acquainted with. Since, therefore he is supposed to have
> known by his touch, that a cube is a body terminated by square
> surfaces, and that a sphere is not terminated by square surfaces; upon
> the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only *in
> numero*, it follows, that he might know, by the unerring mark of the
> square surfaces, which was the cube and which not, while he only saw
> them. We must therefore allow, either that visible extension and
> figures are specifically distinct from tangible extension and figures,
> or else, that the solution of this problem, given by those two
> thoughtful and ingenious men is wrong (§133).

Berkeley, of course, does not think that Molyneux and Locke are wrong.
The thought experiment, he thinks, deserves a negative answer.
