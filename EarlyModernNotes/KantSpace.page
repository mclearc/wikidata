# The Problem with Space

One of the major philosophical disputes in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries concerned the issue of space. What is space? By the
mid-eighteenth century there were two major competing positions. On the
one hand, following Newton, many philosophers and scientists construed
space as a kind of *subsisting entity*. On this view space (and
correspondingly time) exists independently of any possible *objects*
that may occupy space, and independently of any possible *relations*
between such space-occupying objects. Space is, on this view, a kind of
container in which objects are placed. Spatial relations (e.g. position,
relative motion) are determined by the relations which objects have to
this container space, and the relations of this spaces (or spatial
regions) to one another. Call this the ‘*absolute*’ conception of space.

In contrast to the conception of space as absolute, Leibniz proposed
that space is merely a set of relations that hold between independently
specifiable objects. This ‘*relationalist*’ conception of space says
that space is *not* something that exists over and above the objects
which occupy it. It is merely the order of possible relations between
distinct existing substances. So while we could, on the relationalist
view, conceive of empty space, insofar as we conceive of the possible
relations which substances might enter into, space could not exist as
something independent of any such possible objects.

In the *Critique of Pure Reason* Kant argues against *both* of these
theories of the metaphysics of space. His suggestion is that space is
neither a subsisting entity nor a set of relations, but rather a product
of our subjective apprehension of objects that are distinct from us. It
is, in his phrase, a ‘form of intuition’.

## The Metaphysical Exposition of Space

[Kant’s arguments](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-spacetime)
concerning the nature of space and the nature of our representation of
it occur in the ‘Metaphysical Exposition’ of the first *Critique*. Kant
makes four arguments here, which raise a variety of questions concerning
their proper interpretation. Part of the complexity of interpretation is
due to the complex nature of Kant’s arguments. He is trying to do
several things simultaneously. First, he is intervening in a debate
concerning the ontological status of space—is it a subsisting thing
(absolutism) or is it an order of relations (relationalism)? Second, he
is concerned with answering the question as to the origin of our
representation of space. Space is different from the objects that are in
it. So where does this representation come from? Third, Kant is
concerned with the content or nature of the representation of space. Is
it a fundamentally intellectual (conceptual) kind of representation?

Kant’s first two arguments (EMT 29) run as follows:

> (i) Space is not an empirical concept that has been derived from outer
>     experiences. Here is why. When I relate some of my sensations to
>     something outside me (i.e. to something in a spatial position
>     different from mine), and also when I relate them to things that
>     are outside one another—not merely as different but as in
>     different places—I must be *already* representing *space* as the
>     ground of the other representations—·i.e. as the framework or
>     background or setting within which these spatial relations can
>     exist·. So the representation of space can’t be obtained through
>     experience from the relations amongst outer appearances; on the
>     contrary, outer experience can’t be had except *through* this
>     representation.

> (ii) Space is a necessary a priori representation, which underlies all
>     outer intuitions. We can’t construct a representation of a state
>     of affairs in which there isn’t any space, though we can very well
>     have the thought of space with no objects in it. So we have to
>     regard space as a pre-condition for the possibility of
>     appearances, not as a conceptual construct out of them. Space is
>     an a priori representation that necessarily underlies outer
>     appearances.

There are a variety of possible targets for these arguments, but one
target seems clear—viz. the claim that the representation of space is
drawn from the content of our experience. This is particularly clear
from the first argument, as Kant seems to be denying the Lockean claim
(*Essay*, II.xiii.2-4) that the representation of space is derived from
the representation of the distances between objects. Kant’s point (or a
point) in the first argument is that we cannot represent one object as
*distant* from another without already representing them as being in one
space in which they may be related. Kant’s second argument is perhaps
less persuasive, for it argues that we cannot represent a lack of space.
Certainly, this fact would seem to go against the empiricist view of
space as something we learn from experience. But it seems that the
empiricist might counter that once the representation of space is gained
via experience, we cannot part with it psychologically, and so cannot
represent its absence.

Thus, with these first two arguments Kant attempts to refute a
particular position concerning the *source* of our representation of
space—viz. experience. The representation of space is not to be found in
the content of our experience, rather, outer experience presupposes that
its content will consist of spatially related items. Spatial
representation is thus presupposed by our having any representation of
anything distinct from ourselves or other things at all. Thus, if the
first two arguments are correct, the representation of space is a priori
and not empirical.

Kant’s third and fourth arguments (EMT 30) run as follows:

> (iii) The representation of space isn’t a discursive or general
>     *concept*, but rather a pure *intuition*. As a start on seeing
>     why, note this: •We can only represent a single space; any talk of
>     ‘many spaces’ is always understood to refer to *parts* of the one
>     unique space. •And space isn’t an upshot of the assembling of
>     these parts, with the parts coming first and the whole arising out
>     of them. On the contrary, our only thought of the parts is of them
>     as in the one space. •Space is *essentially* single; it is only by
>     marking out boundaries within it that we get complexity in it, and
>     that’s also how we get the general concept of *spaces* or of *a*
>     *space*. Thus, all our spatial •concepts have underlying them an a
>     priori •intuition of space. Similarly, all geometrical
>     propositions (e.g. that two sides of any triangle are together
>     greater than the third) never come from general concepts (e.g. of
>     *line* and *triangle*), but rather are derived from intuition, and
>     indeed derived a priori with absolute certainty.

> (iv) Space is represented as an infinite given magnitude. There’s no
>     way of thinking a *concept* as containing an infinite set of
>     representations within itself. . . .; but that’s how space is
>     thought (for all the parts of space, even to infinity, are
>     simultaneous). So the basic representation of space is an a priori
>     •intuition, not a •concept.

Kant’s aim (or one aim) in the third and fourth arguments is to deny a
particular view concerning the content or nature of the representation
of space. Spatial representation is not fundamentally intellectual or
conceptual, but rather ‘intuitive’. This is not to say that spatial
representation is *sensory*. We do not have a sensory representation of
an infinite space! Kant is trying to carve out room for a position
according to which we have a non-sensory but non-conceptual
representation of an infinite space, which makes possible our
representation of particular spatial expanses. There are similarities
here between Kant’s argument and previous rationalist arguments
concerning the priority of the infinite over the finite. Kant’s third
argument above is that the single infinite expanse of space is prior to,
in the sense of being presupposed by, the existence of any particular
spatial region. Kant’s fourth argument reinforces this by arguing that
*if* spatial representation were conceptual (on Kant’s understanding of
conceptual representation) then we would have to represent an infinite
number of spaces or spatial regions. This would present us with an
infinite task, which we would obviously be unable to accomplish. Since
Kant thinks we clearly do represent space as an infinite expanse, we
must be doing so *non-conceptually*.

## The Ideality of Space

Thus far Kant has made arguments for two of our three topics. He’s
argued that the source of our representation is not empirical, and thus
that the representation of space is a priori. He has also argued that
the nature or ‘content’ of the representation is intuitive rather than
conceptual. But what about the ontology of space? Is space a subsisting
thing, capable of existince independent of any and all objects or their
relations(absolutism)? Or is it merely the set of possible relations
which objects may stand in (relationalism)?

After Kant gives the arguments discussed above he draws two surprising
conclusions (EMT 30-1). First, he argues that

> (a) Space isn’t a •property of, or set of •relations amongst, things
>     in themselves.

This is surprising because, from what Kant has said in the above
arguments, he has only been discussing our *representation* of space.
But here he makes a claim concerning the *metaphysical status* of
space—viz. that it is nothing ‘in itself’. He then goes on to explain
what space actually is.

> (b) Space is nothing but the form of all appearances of outer sense.

So, according to Kant, space is nothing in itself but rather only a
representation—viz. the form by which we represent distinct objects. How
does he get to this conclusion?

First, Kant rejects a presupposition he thinks both the absolutist and
the relationalist about space hold in common—viz. that space is
something independent of the mind in general and our perception (or
intuition) in particular.[^1] In Kant’s terminology space is *ideal* in
virtue of being mind-dependent. Kant makes this point clearer later in
the *Critique* (EMT 185).

> By *transcendental idealism* I mean this doctrine: Appearances are all
> to be regarded as mere representations, not as things in themselves,
> so that time and space are only •sensible forms of our intuition, not
> •states given as existing by themselves and •not conditions of objects
> viewed as things in themselves. To this idealism there is opposed a
> *transcendental realism* that regards time and space as given in
> themselves, independently of our sensibility. The transcendental
> realist thus interprets outer appearances (taking for granted that
> they are real) as things-in-themselves, which exist independently of
> us and of our sensibility, and are therefore outside us—taking the
> phrase ‘outside us’ in its most radical sense. (A369)

This perhaps makes clearer why Kant thought he was making a move with
respect to the debate between absolutists and relationalists about
space—both positions assume that space is ‘transcendentally real’. But
why think that space is ‘transcendentally ideal’ in the first place?
What licenses the move from a claim about space as an a priori intuitive
representation to the claim that space is *only* the form of outer
intuition?

According to Kant, intuition is an ‘immediate’ and ‘singular’ awareness
of an object. This contrasts with the conceptual representation of an
object, which is ‘mediate’ and ‘general’. The role of intuition, Kant
says, is to present us with objects, while concepts allow for thought of
such objects (EMT 28). Kant’s argument for the ideality of space
proceeds from this definition of intuition (cf. @allais2010)

1.  Intuition necessarily involves the presentation of an object
2.  We have an a priori intuition of space (and time)
3.  A priori intuition cannot, by definition, involve the presence of an
    actual object
4.  $\therefore$ Space is nothing other than a ‘pure’ a priori intuition

Kant’s thinking here is that the role of intuition is to present its
subject with an object. Intuition is what makes the difference between
merely thinking or daydreaming about something and actually having it
*present* to one. But, if this is right then there cannot be some
*actual* thing which is present to one in an a priori intuition, since
the definition of the a priori requires that the intuition be
independent of experience and thus of any actual object.

Thus, (1) follows from Kant’s definition of intuition. (2) follows from
the arguments of the Metaphysical exposition concerning the a priority
and intuitive status of our representation of space. (3) is the crucial
premise, but this seems to follow from the fact that a pure intuition
must present something, and that something, in the absence of any
experience, cannot be an actual object, but merely a feature of the mind
itself. This gets us (4), that space is nothing other than a form of
mental representation and not something subsisting in itself, or an
order of possible relations between objects, independent of the mind.

## Incongruent Counterparts

In §13 of the *Prolegomena*, which was a sort of summary version of the
argument of the *Critique of Pure Reason*, intended to introduce Kant’s
readers to the main themes of that work, Kant makes an argument
concerning what he calls ‘incongruent counterparts’, perfectly similar
objects that are mirror images of each other, such as left and right
hands. This argument, he thinks, shows us that space cannot be
mind-independent, but must be an intuition.

Kant was highly enamored of this argument. He used it first in 1768, to
argue that space was Newtonian (absolute) rather than Leibnizian
(relational). In 1770, he used the argument for a different conclusion,
that our knowledge of space is via intuitive not conceptual
representation. The *Prolegomena* argument of 1783 is for a still
different conclusion, that space is ideal. So what exactly is the
argument and how could it serve all these conclusions?

Let’s look briefly at the first two uses of the argument (cf.
@van-cleve1991a; @van-cleve1991b). Kant’s argument against the
Leibnizian relationalist position hinges on the fact that according to
the Leibnizian relationalist, all spatial relations are a function of
the intrinsic features of the relevant objects. So any change in spatial
features is due to some change in the intrinsic, non-relational features
of the object. In brief, Kant’s 1698 argument against Leibnizian
relationalism says that incongruent counterparts like left and right
hands are intrinsically exactly similar. This means that their
orientation in space cannot be due to their ‘internal’ intrinsic,
non-relational features, but must rather be due to something else—viz.
their relation to some absolute space which contains them.

Kant’s 1770 argument takes up this point and applies it to our
representation of space. If, Kant argues, our representation of space
were ultimately purely conceptual (as the Leibnizian argues), then we
should be able, by means of concepts alone, to distinguish incongruent
counterparts. But, he argues, conceptual representation of (e.g.) a left
and a right hand will not differ since such counterparts do not differ
(let us suppose) in any qualitatively intrinsic way (e.g. neither figure
nor internal angles would differ), nor in any quantitative way (they
differ not according to size, etc.). So since there is no intrinsic
difference between the two hands, there is nothing conceptually to
distinguish one as the left and the other as the right. We must
represent their difference by some other means, which Kant argue is by
means of intuition.

The *Prolegomena*’s conclusion that consideration of incongruent
counterparts demonstrates that space is ideal is deeply contested. The
conclusion is not the only thing that is contested, unfortunately, for
it is not at all clear how the argument goes. The passage (EMT 19-20) is
below:

> If two things are completely the same in every respect of quantity and
> quality that can be known about each separately, you would expect it
> to follow that each can be replaced by the other in all cases and in
> all respects, without the exchange causing any recognizable
> difference. That is the case with two-dimensional figures in geometry,
> but not with three-dimensional ones: it can happen that two of them
> have a complete inner agreement yet also have an outer relation such
> that one can’t be replaced by the other. . . . What can be more like
> my hand, and more equal in all points, than its image in the mirror?
> Yet I can’t put such a hand as is seen in the mirror in the place of

> must be done through intuition; it can’t be done through any concept.
> ·That is, it must be done by showing, and can’t be done by telling·.
> (Pr §13)

One possible reading of the argument (cf. @van-cleve1999, ch. 2) goes as
follows:

1.  Incongruent counterparts are different in virtue of their differing
    relations to space as a whole.
2.  All relations among things in themselves are reducible to the
    nonrelational qualities of the relata.
3.  Therefore, if space and figures within it are things in themselves,
    one incongruent counterpart must differ internally from the other.
4.  But, in fact, the counterparts do not differ internally.
5.  Therefore, space itself and incongruent counterpart figures within
    it are not things in themselves.

According to this interpretation of Kant’s argument, Kant’s key move is
with premise (2), which we might call the ‘reducibility premise’. The
idea here is that, according to many philosophers with whose views Kant
was engaged (such as Leibniz), differences between distinct objects (or
substances) were supposed to be grounded in differences between the
intrinsic features of those substances. Here we see a connection to
Kant’s 1698 argument. The Reducibility premise requires that spatial
differences like left-handedness ground out in intrinsic differences
between left and right hands. But there are no such differences (and the
same goes for other kinds of incongruent counterparts) so space and the
things in it must not be things in themselves, or more simply, they must
not be real mind-independent things.

This argument may be successful, or at least valid. But there are
worries. First, premise (2) is not explicitly stated in the Kant’s text.
Second, we need not appeal to space as a whole in the argument. All we
need is that the ‘handedness’ of the incongruent counterparts need not
reduce to their internal features, whatever their relation to space as a
whole. Second, it is not even necessary to point to *incongruent*
counterparts. Such elements of the argument are wholly dispensable. All
the argument needs is for there to be some set of relations that are not
reducible to their relata. There are many spatial relations, such as
distance, which do not seem to so reduce. So why did Kant focus on
incongruent counterparts then?

It’s obvious that Kant put great stock in the argument from incongruent
counterparts, and used it to push a variety of different conclusions.
Unfortunately it is not obvious exactly what the argument is supposed to
be, nor how the fact of such incongruent counterparts could entail three
such different conclusions.
