# Matter & Mechanism

The view of the material world for which Descartes and Locke both argue
was incredibly influential, both for the growth of natural science, and
for the conception of the human being as a member of the natural world.
[G.W.F. Leibniz](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/), while
sympathetic to aspects of the mechanical system, particularly its
attempt to offer explanations in natural philosophy based on a small set
of resources (the features of material body) and appeal to a limited set
of laws (the laws of motion), nevertheless was [extremely
critical](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-physics/) of both
materialism and those aspects of mechanistic explanation realiant upon
it. Here we’ll look at the central features of the theory of matter
which Leibniz criticizes, as well as basic elements of his positive
theory.

Mechanism is the thesis that the natural world in all its diversity can
be explained solely by a small set of features of bodies (size, shape,
motion, and solidity) plus laws of nature governing their interaction.
This explanatory claim often went along with another claim concerning
the nature of body—viz., that body should be understood as a *substance*
existing independently of mind, and either understood as constitutive of
minds (if one were inclined to Materialism), or as a kind of substance
distinct from and intelligible independently of mind or mental
substance.

A question that immediately arises for material substance is whether it
is infinitely divisible or only divisible to some finite degree or
level. The notion of ‘divisible’ that is relevant here is not one
concerned with divisibility *in practice* — i.e. whether someone could
actually infinitely divide a chunk of matter, but rather divisibility
*in principle* — i.e. whether the nature of matter itself admits of
infinite or only finite divisibility. We’ll see that Leibniz denies that
either a finitist or an infinitist answer is metaphysically
satisfactory, and uses this as a motivation for constructing his
idealist metaphysics.

# Leibniz Against Matter

Leibniz articulated a variety of criticisms concerning the prevailing
notion of matter amongst the scientifically minded intelligentsia of the
seventeenth century. We’ll look at two criticisms—first, his criticism
of Descartes’s claim that material bodies are independent substances,
and second his criticism of the ultimate reality of matter.

## Matter is not a Substance

Recall that in Descartes’s metaphysical system, the world consisted of
two kinds of thing, material substance and mental substance. As
substances, material bodies and minds are supposed to individual,
subsistant, things that depend on nothing else for their existence
(nothing, except God, at any rate).

> As for •corporeal substance and mind (i.e. created •thinking
> substance), they can be understood in terms of a single common
> concept, namely this one: things that don’t depend for their existence
> on anything except God. (*Principles* 1.52)

Thus, for Descartes a material substance and a mind are both individual
and independent kinds of thing.

Leibniz insists not only on the independence requirement that Descartes
articulates, but also that there must be *unity* to an individual
substance such that there is some account of its status as *one* (as
opposed to many) thing. Leibniz emphasizes this point clearly in the
*New System*:

> I became aware that it is impossible to find the sources of real unity
> in matter alone, or in what is purely passive, since this is nothing
> but a collection or lumping together of parts ·and parts of parts. . .
> · ad infinitum. Now a real collection or multiplicity must involve
> true unities— ·things each of which is one thing in a more basic way
> than a collection is one thing·—and these true unities must come from
> elsewhere, i.e.cannot themselves be members of the collection. •They
> can’t be material things, because what is material can’t at the same
> time be perfectly indivisible, which is what is needed for true unity.
> (NS §2, p.2)

Leibniz argues here that the ‘true unity’ required to attribute to
matter the status of substance (as thus as recognizing individual
material bodies as substances) cannot be found in matter itself.
Essential to Leibniz’s argument here is his distinction between a mere
collection and a genuine unity. Later in the *New System* Leibniz argues
that a mass of matter

> however organized it may be…can only be thought of as like an army, a
> flock, a pond full of fish, or like a watch composed of springs and
> wheels. There wouldn’t be anything substantial or real in such a
> collection if there were no true substantial unities. (NE §11, p. 5)

Leibniz’s point is that however organized an army or flock of birds may
be, neither the army nor the flock is anything above and beyond its
parts—it is merely an *aggregate*. Since there is nothing to an
aggregate individual beyond its parts—in Leibniz’s terms, there is no
principle of unity for the aggregate (though perhaps Leibniz would
change his mind if he knew about the [murmurations of
starlings](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/02/the-murmurations-of-starlings/100690/))—there
is no sense in which the whole aggregate is *independent* in the way
required for it to be a substance.

<!-- NOTE: So Leibniz sees an intimate connection between the unity of a thing and its independence, at least for the purposes of this argument. Is that plausible? -->

The obvious move here is to say that some material bodies are
unities—viz., *atoms*. Leibniz anticipates this with his claim that
“what is material can’t at the same time be perfectly indivisible”. But
this isn’t, of itself, a convincing argument since it is simply the
denial of the atomist’s thesis that some material bodies are
indivisible. The atomist claims that there is a ‘ground floor’ of
materiality, where there are material bodies—atoms—without any parts.
Leibniz, however, does provide something in the way of an argument
against this.

> “•atoms of matter are contrary to reason; and anyway an atom, if there
> were such a thing, would still be composed of parts ·and so wouldn’t
> be a true unity after all·. One part’s being attached to another so
> strongly that they couldn’t be pulled apart (supposing we could make
> sense of this) wouldn’t alter the fact that these were two parts, one
> different from the other. It is only •atoms of substance, that is to
> say real unities absolutely devoid of parts, that can be •the sources
> of activity, •the absolutely basic reasons for the composition of
> things (·explaining why composite things have such togetherness, such
> non-basic unity, as they do have·), and, as it were, •the ultimate
> elements in the analysis of substantial things.” (NS §11, p.5)

Leibniz claims several things here. First, he argues that the notion of
a material atom is ‘contrary to reason’. Why would that be? One of
Leibniz’s fundamental intellectual commitments is to what he calls the
‘[Principle of Sufficient
Reason](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/)’ (PRS).
PRS states that everything that exists must have an intelligible ground
for its existence. Put another way, every fact must have an explanation.

The claim that atoms of matter are contrary to reason, then, is the
claim that their existence would violate the PRS. Leibniz’s idea here is
that the existence of an material atom would mean the existence of an
extended being which was not divisible. But Leibniz thinks that it is
simply a contradiction to claim that an extended being is not divisible.
This is because extended beings are extended in space, and just as it is
always mathematically possible to divide the space which an object
occupies into further spaces so too should it be possible to divide the
object itself into further parts, each of which is an occupant of this
space. This was particularly true of those, like
[Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/#3), who
thought of material extension as *identical* with spatial extension
(i.e. that there was no distinction between matter and the space that it
occupies). To argue, as the atomist does, that some material bodies are
indivisible, is to assert that there is arbitrary stopping point in the
cycle of division, an arbitrariness that goes against the PSR.

Leibniz seems to be aware that this appeal to the PSR may not be fully
convincing and so provides a second argument.

> an atom, if there were such a thing, would still be composed of parts
> ·and so wouldn’t be a true unity after all·. One part’s being attached
> to another so strongly that they couldn’t be pulled apart (supposing
> we could make sense of this) wouldn’t alter the fact that these were
> two parts, one different from the other.

Here his argument again appeals to the claim that things extended in
space are going to have parts, presumably corresponding to the different
parts of space that they occupy. Leibniz argues that the indivisibility
of an atom (assuming, for the sake of argument, that it is indivisible)
is not enough to show that it lacks parts. If the atomist admits the
existence of such parts then Leibniz can appeal to his independence
argument. Things with parts are dependent on their parts and thus are
not independent in the way required of substance. They are, in Leibniz’s
terms, ‘accidental’ rather than ‘real’ unities.

## Matter is not Ultimately Real

If Leibniz’s arguments against the substantive status of matter are
successful then they show that matter is not to be understood as an
ultimate, and independent, entity. But Leibniz does not stop with this
point. He further argues that the very reality of matter should be
called into question.

Let’s look again at the aggregate passage:

> a simple mass of matter, however organized it may be…can only be
> thought of as like an army, a flock, a pond full of fish, or like a
> watch composed of springs and wheels. There wouldn’t be anything
> substantial or real in such a collection if there were no true
> substantial unities. (NE §11, p. 5)

So matter, even understood as an aggregate, would not be real if there
were not substantial unities which grounded it.[^1] Leibniz thinks that
this must be a non-material entity—a ‘metaphysical point’, or what he
would later call a ‘monad’. Looking again at the passage discussing
unity near the beginning of the *New System*:

> Now a real collection or multiplicity must involve true unities—
> ·things each of which is one thing in a more basic way than a
> collection is one thing·—and these true unities must come from
> elsewhere, i.e.cannot themselves be members of the collection. •They
> can’t be material things, because what is material can’t at the same
> time be perfectly indivisible, which is what is needed for true unity.
> •And they can’t be mathematical points either: something continuous
> can’t be made up of points, because points are not things; rather,
> facts about them are just facts about extended things, e.g. facts
> about where they end, where their limits are. (·Thus, to say that two
> lines intersect at a certain point is not to say that there is a point
> at which the lines intersect; rather, it is to say where they
> intersect; in a fundamental account of this statement, the noun
> ‘point’ doesn’t have to occur at all·.) So in order to get a real
> unity—·a thing that is deep-down just one thing·—I had to bring in
> what might be called a real and living point, an atom of substance
> that is a complete being only because it contains some kind of form or
> activity." (NS §2, p.2)

Leibniz argues that the reality of matter requires the existence of
‘true unities’, but matter is not the kind of thing that could itself be
a ‘true unity’ so there must be something else—a ‘real and living
point’—whose existence grounds and explains the existence of matter. How
does Leibniz’s argument work?

1.  Matter (material body) is nothing but a collection or aggregate of
    parts
2.  Any real aggregate must ultimately be composed of parts which are
    not themselves aggregates—viz., ‘true unities’
3.  True unities cannot be material (b/c they must be indivisible) or
    mathematical (b/c mathematical points are not real)
4.  $\therefore$ The reality of matter depends on a non-material true
    unity

Would the atomist or ‘corpuscularian’ agree with this argument? Both
would agree with the first premise, that material bodies are collections
of parts. But why should we endorse premises (2) and (3)? Leibniz does
nothing to motivate these premises beyond the kind of analogical
arguments surrounding the unreality of aggregates like flocks of birds
or piles of stones—aggregates are nothing more than the sum of their
parts.

In the background of Leibniz’s argument is something we might call the
‘Principle of Borrowed Reality’ (PBR). Leibniz makes this point quite
clearly in a [1686
letter](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfs/leibniz1686a.pdf) to the
Jesuit priest and philosopher [Antoine
Arnauld](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arnauld/):

> One will never find a body of which one can say that it is truly a [or
> one] substance. It will always be an aggregate of several. Or rather,
> it will not be a real being, since the parts that compose it are
> subject to the same difficulty, and since one never arrives at any
> real being, as *beings by aggregation have only as much reality as
> there is in their components*. From this it follows that the substance
> of a body, if they have one, must be indivisible, whether it is called
> soul or form does not matter to me (Leibniz to Arnauld, EMT 45; my
> emphasis)

Is the PBR plausible? There is certainly something intuitive about it. A
building is only as real as the materials that constitute it. A painting
is only as real as the flecks of paint that make it up. What’s more, it
seems that the corpuscularian is at a disadvantage here because they too
would seem to want to endorse the principle, as it is part of the
explanatory power of corpuscularianism (or any hierarchical metaphysical
theory) that the macroscopic world is built out of, and ultimately
depends upon, the features of the microscopic world and interactions
between such microscopic entities.

So, just as the finitist or atomist response to the issue of division is
unsatisfactory because of its arbitraryness (and thus its violation of
PSR), the infinitist answer to the issue of division violates the PBR.
Thus, according to Leibniz, we cannot countenance matter as substantial
or real. Leibniz’s positive views on the status of matter seem to change
over the course of his life. At the point of writing the *New System*
(1695) Leibniz considered matter to be real but not ultimately so, its
existence and unity being dependent on the existence of substantial
forms or souls.

> It is only metaphysical or substantial points (constituted by forms or
> souls) that are both exact and real, and without them there wouldn’t
> be any things at all, because without true unities there would be no
> multiplicity—·without true ones there would be no manies·. (NE §11,
> p. 5)

By the time he writes the *Monadology* (1714) Leibniz has given up on
the reality of matter altogether, arguing that it is only a perception
existing in the mind of the perceiver. He states this clearly in a 1712
letter to Bartholomew des Bosses, Jesuit teacher of theology and a
professor of mathematics at Cologne.

> I consider the explanation of all phenomena solely through the
> perceptions of monads functioning in harmony with each other, with
> corporeal substances rejected, to be useful for a fundamental
> investigation of things…It is true that things which happen in the
> soul must agree with those which happen outside of it. But for this it
> is enough for the things taking place in one soul to correspond with
> each other as well as with those happening in any other soul, and it
> is not necessary to assume anything outside of all souls or monads.
> According to this hypothesis, we mean nothing else when we say that
> Socrates is sitting down than that what we understand by ‘Socrates’
> and by ‘sitting down’ is appearing to us and to others who are
> concerned. (Letter to des Bosses, 16 June, 1712)

This position, subsequently called ‘*phenomenalism*’, construes the
material world as nothing more than the orderly perceptual appearances
of an underlying non-material order of mind-like substances or ‘monads’.
