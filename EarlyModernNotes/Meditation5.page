# The Structure of *Meditation* 5

1.  Essence of matter is extension (7:63, 71; EMT M.23, 26)
2.  Innate ideas of essences (7:63–5; EMT M.23)
3.  Ontological argument (7:65–8; EMT M.24-5)
4.  Primacy of clear and vivid perception (7:68–9; EMT M.25)
5.  Knowledge of God needed to banish doubt (7:69–71; EMT M.25-6)

# The Ontological Argument

## Structure of the Argument

1.  Statement of the ontological argument (7:65; EMT M.24)
2.  Objection 1: existence is separable from essence (7:66; EMT M.24)
3.  Objection 2: existence in thought is different from real existence
    (7:66; EMT M.24)
4.  Objection 3: the necessity of God's existence is only hypothetical
    (7:67; EMT M.25)

## The Argument

The [ontological
argument](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-%20ontological/)
differs from Descartes's previous proofs in that it purports to prove
God's existence simply from an innate and clear and distinct idea of His
essence. So this isn't a proof that relies on the cause of the idea, or
on the finitude of the subject.

> I can easily believe that in the case of God, also, existence can be
> separated from essence, ·letting us answer the •essence question about
> God while leaving the •existence question open·, so that God can be
> thought of as not existing. But on more careful reflection it becomes
> quite evident that, just as having-internal-angles-equal-to-180° can’t
> be separated from the idea ·or essence· of a triangle, and as the idea
> of highlands can’t be separated from the idea of lowlands, so
> existence can’t be separated from the essence of God. (7:65; EMT M.24)

The proof differs from [previous
versions](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/) of
the ontological argument, in that it does not depend on an arbitrary
definition of God but rather an innate idea whose content is clearly and
vividly perceived. Thus, just as one can come to know basic geometrical
truths by reflecting on the content of geometric ideas, Descartes thinks
one also comes to know that God exists, just by reflection on the
content of one's idea.

## The Three Objections

### Existence and Essence

The first objection is that we readily distinguish between the essence
of a thing, what it is for that thing to be the kind of thing it is, and
the existence of a thing. A ready example of this can be seen in
geometry. Geometrical figures, as described by, e.g. Euclid, have
essences. That is, they have definite characteristics that categorize
them as the things they are (triangles have three sides and angles that
sum to 180˚, quadrilateral figures have four sides and angles that sum
to 360˚, etc.). However, it would be wrong to say that, for these
figures, their essence is inseperable from their existence. If we can
make this distinction in the case of geometric figures, then why not
with God?

Descartes replies that careful consideration of the content of the idea
of God shows us that God's essence is insperable from His existence.

> on more careful reflection it becomes quite evident that, just as
> having-internal-angles-equal-to-180° can’t be separated from the idea
> ·or essence· of a triangle, and as the idea of highlands can’t be
> separated from the idea of lowlands, so existence can’t be separated
> from the essence of God. Just as it is self-contradictory to think of
> highlands in a world where there are no lowlands, so it is
> self-contradictory to think of God as not existing---that is, to think
> of a supremely perfect being as lacking a perfection, namely the
> perfection of existence. (7:66; EMT M.24)

Here we get a clarificationn of Descartes's view. The reason why it
would be self-contradictory to think of God as lacking existence is
because existence, according to Descartes, is a perfection, and God has
all perfections, so He must also exist.

### Real or Fictitious?

The next objection worries about how we can be sure that the content of
our ideas matches reality.

> I can’t think of God except as existing, just as I can’t think of a
> river without banks. From the latter fact, though, it certainly
> doesn’t follow that there are any rivers in the world; so why should
> it follow from the former fact that God exists? How things are in
> reality is not settled by my thought; and just as I can imagine a
> winged horse even though no horse has wings, so I can attach existence
> to God in my thought even if no God exists. (7:66-7; EMT M.24)

So the objection asks (i) whether it would follow simply from one's
thought that God exists that He exists, which (ii) seems fallacious
given other examples of fictitious thought, such as thinking of a winged
horse.

Descartes replies that this objection gets things the wrong way round.

> from the fact that I can’t think of God except as existing it follows
> that God and existence are inseparable, which is to say that God
> really exists. My thought doesn’t make it so; it doesn’t create
> necessities. The influence runs the opposite way: the necessity of the
> thing constrains how I can think, depriving me of the freedom to think
> of God without existence (that is, a supremely perfect being without a
> supreme perfection), like my freedom to imagine a horse with or
> without wings.

Descartes denies that his claim is that thinking makes it so---the
necessity of God's features constrain our thinking concerning them.
Descartes also denies that the connection could be merely fictitious. If
it were then the connection would be under the thinker's control, in the
way that thinking of a horse as winged (or not) is under the thinker's
control. Hence, Descartes assumes that thought of fictitious connections
is always subject to the thinker's will, while what is intrinsically
connected will be inseperable in thought.

### Hypothetical Necessity

> once I have supposed that •all perfections belong to God, I must
> suppose that he exists, because existence is one of the perfections.
> But what entitles me to suppose God to have all perfections?
> Similarly, if I suppose that •all quadrilaterals can be inscribed in a
> circle, I have to conclude that a rhombus can be inscribed in a
> circle; but that is plainly false, which shows that the original
> supposition was wrong. (7:67; EMT M.25)

In other words, if we assume that God has all perfections, and that
existence is such a perfection, then Descartes's conclusion follows. But
why make these assumptions?

Descartes's reply again draws on the distinction between the content of
a fictitious idea, whose characterisitcs may be seperated at will, and
the content of the idea of God, which necessarily posits His possession
of all perfections, including existence.

> I agree that I don’t have to think about God at all; but whenever I do
> choose to think of him, bringing the idea of the first and supreme
> being out of my mind’s store, I must attribute all perfections to him,
> even if I don’t attend to them individually straight away. This
> necessity ·in my thought· guarantees that, when I later realize that
> existence is a perfection, I am right to conclude then that the first
> and supreme being exists...When on the other hand I examine what
> figures can be inscribed in a circle, I am not compelled to think that
> this class includes all quadrilaterals. Indeed, I cannot—while
> thinking vividly and clearly—even pretend that all quadrilaterals can
> be inscribed in a circle.

So the idea of God includes \<existence\>, in the just the same
(necessary) way that the idea of a triangle includes \<three sided\>. We
know that "This idea isn’t a fiction, a creature of my thought, but
rather an image of a true and unchanging nature" because we have a clear
and vivid perception of it.

## Caterus's Objection

> Let it be granted that the word ‘God’ means to everyone what this
> argument says it means, namely ‘something such that nothing greater
> than it can be thought of’. But it doesn’t follow from this that
> everyone understands that ‘God’ signifies something that exists in the
> real world. All that follows is that everyone understands that ‘God’
> signifies something that exists in the thought of the intellect. To
> show that this being exists in the real world you need the premise
> that there really is something such that nothing greater than it can
> be thought of; and that premise won’t be allowed by ·the very people
> you are trying to argue against, namely· those who maintain that God
> doesn’t exist. (7:99; EMT M.11-12)

In other words, do we really know that such a being exists that
corresponds to our concept? Descartes takes the objection to be a
version of the second objection discussed above---viz., whether the
concept of God is fictional. But Caterus seems to be objecting to the
claim that our ideas reliably and accurately track the nature of
extra-mental reality, not the claim that our idea of God is fictitious.
Caterus's objection is especially telling, given that for Descartes the
idea of God is innate. The question is thus how an innate idea, an idea
that does not originate from the external world, could nevertheless
accurately reflect reality. This worry holds as much for geometrical
figures, which determine the essential properties of all material
beings, as it does for God.

Descartes's argument really hinges on his fundamental claim that clear
and vivid ideas, despite their being innate, provide us with an adequate
representation of reality. This would seem to point to the truth rule
--- the idea that clear and vivid ideas are true and sufficient for
knowledge. Hence, we have to consider the justification for the truth
rule, if there is any.

# The Cartesian Circle

As was suggested in the discussion of the *Third Meditation*, the need
for a proof of God hinges, at least in part, on the need for a
certification of clear and vivid ideas as guaranteeing truth. At the end
of the *Fifth Meditation* Descartes makes clear that such a proof is
necessary if we are to achieve certainty of even the simplest things,
such as basic mathematical truths.

> But now I have seen that God exists, and have understood that
> everything else depends on him and that he is not a deceiver; from
> which I have inferred that everything that I vividly and clearly
> perceive must be true. So even when I am no longer attending to the
> arguments that led me to accept this (·i.e. the proposition about
> triangles·), as long as I remember that I vividly and clearly
> perceived it no counter-arguments can make me doubt it. It is
> something that I know for certain ·and in an unshakable way· to be
> true...Thus I see plainly that the certainty and truth of all
> knowledge depends strictly on my awareness of the true God. So much so
> that until I became aware of him I couldn’t perfectly know anything.
> (EMT M.26)

In the *Third Meditation* Descartes argued that his clear and vivid idea
of God grounded certainty of God's existence. God's existence and nature
were then used to ground the truth rule. Arnauld, in the *Fourth
Objections* points out that this reasoning is circular.

> I have one further worry, namely how Descartes avoids reasoning in a
> circle when he says that it’s only because ·we know that· God exists
> that we are sure that whatever we vividly and clearly perceive is
> true. But we can be sure that God exists only because we vividly and
> clearly perceive this; so before we can be sure that God exists we
> need to be able to be sure that whatever we perceive clearly and
> evidently is true. (7:214; EMT O&R.75)

Descartes's reply relies on the distinction between knowledge, at a
time, derived from one's clear and vivid ideas, and knowledge at some
later time based on the *memory* of such a derivation (EMT O&R.75; cf.
O&R.25-6). Descartes argues that the *proof* of God relies only the on
the clear and vivid idea of God, while the subject's capacity to
*retain* knowledge (but not the reliability of clear and vivid ideas
themselves), such as through memory, relies on the the proof of God's
existence, and the fact that He is no deceiver.

Is this a convincing means of getting out of the circle?
