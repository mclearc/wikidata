<h1 id="the-problem-with-space">The Problem with Space</h1>
<p>One of the major philosophical disputes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries concerned the issue of space. What is space? By the mid-eighteenth century there were two major competing positions. On the one hand, following Newton, many philosophers and scientists construed space as a kind of <em>subsisting entity</em>. On this view space (and correspondingly time) exists independently of any possible <em>objects</em> that may occupy space, and independently of any possible <em>relations</em> between such space-occupying objects. Space is, on this view, a kind of container in which objects are placed. Spatial relations (e.g. position, relative motion) are determined by the relations which objects have to this container space, and the relations of this spaces (or spatial regions) to one another. Call this the ‘<em>absolute</em>’ conception of space.</p>
<p>In contrast to the conception of space as absolute, Leibniz proposed that space is merely a set of relations that hold between independently specifiable objects. This ‘<em>relationalist</em>’ conception of space says that space is <em>not</em> something that exists over and above the objects which occupy it. It is merely the order of possible relations between distinct existing substances. So while we could, on the relationalist view, conceive of empty space, insofar as we conceive of the possible relations which substances might enter into, space could not exist as something independent of any such possible objects.</p>
<p>In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> Kant argues against <em>both</em> of these theories of the metaphysics of space. His suggestion is that space is neither a subsisting entity nor a set of relations, but rather a product of our subjective apprehension of objects that are distinct from us. It is, in his phrase, a ‘form of intuition’.</p>
<h2 id="the-metaphysical-exposition-of-space">The Metaphysical Exposition of Space</h2>
<p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-spacetime">Kant’s arguments</a> concerning the nature of space and the nature of our representation of it occur in the ‘Metaphysical Exposition’ of the first <em>Critique</em>. Kant makes four arguments here, which raise a variety of questions concerning their proper interpretation. Part of the complexity of interpretation is due to the complex nature of Kant’s arguments. He is trying to do several things simultaneously. First, he is intervening in a debate concerning the ontological status of space—is it a subsisting thing (absolutism) or is it an order of relations (relationalism)? Second, he is concerned with answering the question as to the origin of our representation of space. Space is different from the objects that are in it. So where does this representation come from? Third, Kant is concerned with the content or nature of the representation of space. Is it a fundamentally intellectual (conceptual) kind of representation?</p>
<p>Kant’s first two arguments (EMT 29) run as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is not an empirical concept that has been derived from outer experiences. Here is why. When I relate some of my sensations to something outside me (i.e. to something in a spatial position different from mine), and also when I relate them to things that are outside one another—not merely as different but as in different places—I must be <em>already</em> representing <em>space</em> as the ground of the other representations—·i.e. as the framework or background or setting within which these spatial relations can exist·. So the representation of space can’t be obtained through experience from the relations amongst outer appearances; on the contrary, outer experience can’t be had except <em>through</em> this representation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is a necessary a priori representation, which underlies all outer intuitions. We can’t construct a representation of a state of affairs in which there isn’t any space, though we can very well have the thought of space with no objects in it. So we have to regard space as a pre-condition for the possibility of appearances, not as a conceptual construct out of them. Space is an a priori representation that necessarily underlies outer appearances.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a variety of possible targets for these arguments, but one target seems clear—viz. the claim that the representation of space is drawn from the content of our experience. This is particularly clear from the first argument, as Kant seems to be denying the Lockean claim (<em>Essay</em>, II.xiii.2-4) that the representation of space is derived from the representation of the distances between objects. Kant’s point (or a point) in the first argument is that we cannot represent one object as <em>distant</em> from another without already representing them as being in one space in which they may be related. Kant’s second argument is perhaps less persuasive, for it argues that we cannot represent a lack of space. Certainly, this fact would seem to go against the empiricist view of space as something we learn from experience. But it seems that the empiricist might counter that once the representation of space is gained via experience, we cannot part with it psychologically, and so cannot represent its absence.</p>
<p>Thus, with these first two arguments Kant attempts to refute a particular position concerning the <em>source</em> of our representation of space—viz. experience. The representation of space is not to be found in the content of our experience, rather, outer experience presupposes that its content will consist of spatially related items. Spatial representation is thus presupposed by our having any representation of anything distinct from ourselves or other things at all. Thus, if the first two arguments are correct, the representation of space is a priori and not empirical.</p>
<p>Kant’s third and fourth arguments (EMT 30) run as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The representation of space isn’t a discursive or general <em>concept</em>, but rather a pure <em>intuition</em>. As a start on seeing why, note this: •We can only represent a single space; any talk of ‘many spaces’ is always understood to refer to <em>parts</em> of the one unique space. •And space isn’t an upshot of the assembling of these parts, with the parts coming first and the whole arising out of them. On the contrary, our only thought of the parts is of them as in the one space. •Space is <em>essentially</em> single; it is only by marking out boundaries within it that we get complexity in it, and that’s also how we get the general concept of <em>spaces</em> or of <em>a</em> <em>space</em>. Thus, all our spatial •concepts have underlying them an a priori •intuition of space. Similarly, all geometrical propositions (e.g. that two sides of any triangle are together greater than the third) never come from general concepts (e.g. of <em>line</em> and <em>triangle</em>), but rather are derived from intuition, and indeed derived a priori with absolute certainty.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Space is represented as an infinite given magnitude. There’s no way of thinking a <em>concept</em> as containing an infinite set of representations within itself. . . .; but that’s how space is thought (for all the parts of space, even to infinity, are simultaneous). So the basic representation of space is an a priori •intuition, not a •concept.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Kant’s aim (or one aim) in the third and fourth arguments is to deny a particular view concerning the content or nature of the representation of space. Spatial representation is not fundamentally intellectual or conceptual, but rather ‘intuitive’. This is not to say that spatial representation is <em>sensory</em>. We do not have a sensory representation of an infinite space! Kant is trying to carve out room for a position according to which we have a non-sensory but non-conceptual representation of an infinite space, which makes possible our representation of particular spatial expanses. There are similarities here between Kant’s argument and previous rationalist arguments concerning the priority of the infinite over the finite. Kant’s third argument above is that the single infinite expanse of space is prior to, in the sense of being presupposed by, the existence of any particular spatial region. Kant’s fourth argument reinforces this by arguing that <em>if</em> spatial representation were conceptual (on Kant’s understanding of conceptual representation) then we would have to represent an infinite number of spaces or spatial regions. This would present us with an infinite task, which we would obviously be unable to accomplish. Since Kant thinks we clearly do represent space as an infinite expanse, we must be doing so <em>non-conceptually</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ideality-of-space">The Ideality of Space</h2>
<p>Thus far Kant has made arguments for two of our three topics. He’s argued that the source of our representation is not empirical, and thus that the representation of space is a priori. He has also argued that the nature or ‘content’ of the representation is intuitive rather than conceptual. But what about the ontology of space? Is space a subsisting thing, capable of existince independent of any and all objects or their relations(absolutism)? Or is it merely the set of possible relations which objects may stand in (relationalism)?</p>
<p>After Kant gives the arguments discussed above he draws two surprising conclusions. First, he argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Space isn’t a •property of, or set of •relations amongst, things in themselves.</li>
</ol>
