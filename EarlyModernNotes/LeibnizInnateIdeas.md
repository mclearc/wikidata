# Leibniz’s *New Essays on Human Understanding*

[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/)
(1646–1716) wrote the *New Essays* (or ‘*Nouveaux essais sur
l’entendement humain*’, as it was originally called in French) as an
extended commentary on Locke’s *Essay Concerning Human Understanding*.
It was finished in 1704, and is one of only two long-form works that
Leibniz completed (the other being his *Theodicy* of 1710). However,
Locke died shortly after Leibniz completed the work and he is reported
to have decided against publishing a critical work on Locke so soon
after his death. Leibniz thus put the manuscript away and it would not
end up being published until long after Leibniz had died, in 1765.

Though originally written as a philosophical treatise and commentary,
Leibniz converted the book to dialogue form in order to make it more
reader friendly. This was probably a mistake. Despite the awkwardness of
its presentation it is an important work, both as a statement of
Leibniz’s views, and as a sophisticated and sustained rationalist
treatment of the nature of the mind.

The dialogue takes place between two figures: Philalethes (‘lover of
truth’ - who broadly represents Locke) and Theophilus (‘lover of God’ -
who broadly represents Leibniz).

# On Innate Ideas

In the opening pages of the *New Essays* Leibniz explicitly aligns his
philosophical views with those of Plato and against what he takes to be
the Aristotelian empiricism of Locke. He says,

> although Locke says hundreds of fine things that I applaud, our
> systems are very different. His is closer to Aristotle and mine to
> Plato, although each of us parts company at many points from the
> teachings of both these ancient writers. (I.Preface.2)[^1]

## The Dispositional Account of Ideas

> Locke seems to claim that in us there is nothing potential, indeed
> nothing of which we aren’t always actually aware. But he can’t hold
> strictly to this, for that would make his position too paradoxical.
> ·It is obvious to everyone, and Locke would presumably not deny it,
> that· we aren’t always aware of dispositions that we do nevertheless
> have (I.Preface.4)

Leibniz is here trying to avoid one of the central criticisms Locke
levies at the strong version of Nativism—viz., that if we are not aware
of innate ideas or principles, as children and the various others Locke
lists presumably are not, then we do not have any innate ideas.

What Leibniz points out is that there are many ideas that a subject
might be said to ‘have’ in the sense that the subject has the
disposition to think using them (e.g. if I tell you that an elephant
makes a poor typist you come to have a thought that you presumably
weren’t entertaining a moment ago, but nevertheless had the disposition
to do so).

Recall that Locke argued against two versions of Nativist view.
According to the strong version all children would have knowledge of
metaphysical and logical truths. Locke thinks this is clearly
empirically false. According to the weak version, ideas and principles
are innate in the sense that through the use of reason, mature and
rational people would come to assent to the content of the ideas or
principles. But Locke thinks this is either false (because it would make
derivative knowledge innate) or trivial (because it would make all
knowledge innate).

Locke puts the triviality thesis this way,

> All that is left for these innatists to claim is this·: Maxims or
> innate truths are never known or noticed before the use of reason, and
> may be assented to at some time after that, but there is no saying
> when. But that is true of all other knowable truths; so it doesn’t
> help to mark off innately known truths from others. (EHU I.ii.13)

We saw that Descartes has his own reply to the argument Locke levies at
strong Nativism based on the claim that prior to adulthood the mind is
too immersed in the sensory experience of the body to adequately reflect
on the innate ideas it possesses. But the triviality worry is perhaps
more difficult to answer. Leibniz takes up this challenge.

> **Phil**: But suppose that truths can be imprinted on the
> understanding without being perceived by it: I don’t see how they can
> differ, so far as their origin is concerned, from ones that the
> understanding is merely capable of coming to know.

> **Theo**: The mind is capable not merely of •knowing them but of
> •finding them within itself. If all it had was the mere capacity to
> receive those items of knowledge—a passive power to do so, as
> indeterminate as the power of wax to receive shapes or of an empty
> page to receive words—it wouldn’t be the source of necessary truths,
> as I have just shown that it is. (I.i.20)

So the challenge that Leibniz takes up from Locke is to show how the
innateness of at least some ideas is compatible with (i) their being
dispositions, and thus of our not always being aware of them (as with
children) and (ii) the trivial claim that the mind has a capacity to
understand things that are presented to it.

Leibniz tries to illustrate the non-trivial sense in which he thinks
innate ideas are dispositional by appeal to an analogy.

> If the soul were like an empty page, then truths would be in us in the
> way that the shape of Hercules is in an uncarved piece of marble that
> is entirely neutral as to whether it takes Hercules’ shape or some
> other. Contrast that piece of marble with one that is veined in a way
> that marks out the shape of Hercules rather than other shapes. This
> latter block would be more inclined to take that shape than the former
> would, and Hercules would be in a way innate in it, even though it
> would take a lot of work to expose the veins and to polish them into
> clarity. This is how ideas and truths are innate in us—as
> inclinations, dispositions, tendencies, or natural potentialities, and
> not as actual thinkings, though these potentialities are always
> accompanied by certain actual thinkings, often insensible ones, which
> correspond to them. (I.Preface.4; cf.I.i.21, 24-5)

There is a sense in which the figure of Hercules is ‘in’ the second
block of marble in a way in which it is not ‘in’ the first block.
According to Leibniz, the second, veined block would be more ‘inclined’
or disposed to take on the shape of Hercules. So the claim is not that
the mind is simply a passive capacity to understand what it is presented
with, but rather that it has an inclination or propensity—a
disposition—to understand certain kinds of things and in particular
ways. This needn’t show that the dispositions possessed by the mind are
*reliable*. Something more would need to be said for that conclusion.
But Leibniz’s point is perhaps enough to avoid the worry of triviality.

On Leibniz’s view, the basic principles of logic, mathematics, and
metaphysics are all principles which work with the grain of the mind (to
stay with the marble analogy).

## ‘Potential’ Knowledge

In addition to Leibniz’s claim that our innate knowledge is
dispositional (or that the ideas which constitute this knowledge are
dispositional), Leibniz also argues that we have inexplicit or
‘potential’ knowledge.

> we use these [logical] maxims without having them explicitly in mind.
> It’s rather like what happens with enthymemes [= ‘arguments in which
> one or more of the premises is left unstated’]: we have the suppressed
> premises potentially in mind although they are absent not only from
> our statement of the argument but also from our thinking of it.
> (I.i.18)

Leibniz argues that, for example, ‘all the propositions of arithmetic
and geometry should be regarded as innate’ (I.i.19). Exactly what he
means by this is not altogether clear. It would seem to invite just the
kinds of empirical objections that Locke raises in his *Essay*. The
appeal to enthymemes suggests one possible interpretation of Leibniz’s
argument. An enthymeme is an argument with a missing or ‘suppressed’
premise. For example, the inference that ‘Locke is mortal because he is
human’ is enthymatic. It fails to make explicit the premise that all
humans are mortal. Once that premise is made explicit the inference is
valid. Presumably, any person who made the former inference would be
prepared to make the latter, in which the missing premise is made
explicit.

Leibniz might be thinking that something similar is true of innate
ideas. One is said to have them enthymematically in the sense that, when
challenged one would be able to supply the missing premise in an
argument.

In the end, though, it isn’t really clear that this strategy is sound.
The claim that certain mathematical truths follow logically from others
in no way guarantees that if someone is certain that 2 + 2 = 4 is true,
that they have come to that truth by means of a manipulation of logical
rules (as Leibniz believes) (cf. @wilson1967, 359). Worse, it isn’t
clear how we could attribute such ‘potential’ knowledge to children, who
seem unable to explain the abstract principles that justify their
certainty in particular truths such as the principle of
non-contradiction and the denial of some particular contradiction. The
child simply cannot articulate the general principle when challenged. So
Leibniz’s appeal to enthymemes isn’t obviously plausible, at least as a
general explanation of the ‘potential’ way in which innate ideas are
known.

## Reflection and Innateness

In response to the Lockean view that we gain many ideas via reflection
Leibniz makes the following puzzling claim:

> After devoting the whole of *Essay* Book I to rejecting innate
> illumination, understood in a certain sense, at the start of Book II
> and from there on he admits that some ideas don’t originate in
> •sensation and instead come from •reflection. But to *reflect* is
> simply to *attend to what is within us*, and **something that we carry
> with us already is not something that came from the senses!** So it
> can’t be denied that there is a great deal that is innate in our minds
> ·and didn’t come through the senses·, because we are innate to
> ourselves, so to speak. (I.Preface.4)

Leibniz’s claim seems to be that it is in virtue of reflection on one’s
own nature that one comes to have the innate ideas characteristic of
metaphysics and logic (e.g. *being, unity, change, identity, etc.*). Is
such reflection supposed to be equivalent to innateness?

Remember that, for Locke, reflection is,

> the notice that the mind takes of *what* it is doing, and *how*. (I am
> here using ‘operations’ in a broad sense, to cover not only the
> *actions* of the mind on its ideas but also *passive states* that can
> arise from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising
> from any thought.) (II.i.4)

Locke, interestingly, seems to take the kinds of activity (or
‘operation’) of which the mind is capable as being themselves innate.
There are certain things that minds can *do* simply in virtue of being
minds. What Locke denies is that the mind has any material upon which to
work prior to experience.

Is there a substantive disagreement here between Locke and Leibniz?

## Leibniz’s Reasons for Denying the ‘Blank Slate’ Claim

According to Locke’s positive conception of the mind, the mind is a
‘tabula rasa’ or blank slate, which derives all of its knowledge from
experience. Experience consists of two sources—sensations, or ideas from
external things, and reflection, or ideas gained from introspecting on
the activity of the mind.

1.  **Parallelism**: There is no genuine causal interaction between
    minds and bodies
2.  **Individuation**: Minds cannot be qualitatively identical (because
    blank) but numerically distinct at birth/creation
3.  **Necessity**: Sense experience can never give us knowledge of
    necessary truths, but only of contingent matters of fact

Leibniz finds the denial of innate ideas to be the result of confused
thinking concerning the nature of mind—specifically, of confusing it (if
only analogically) with body.

> I admit that experience is necessary if the soul is to be given
> such-and-such ·specific· thoughts, and if it is to attend to the ideas
> that are within us. But how could experience and the senses provide
> the ideas? Does the soul have windows? Is it similar to writing-paper
> or like wax? Clearly, those who take this view of the soul are
> treating it as basically a material thing. (II.i.36)

In support of (3) Leibniz says the following:

> Although the senses are necessary for all our actual knowledge, they
> aren’t sufficient to provide it all, because The senses never give us
> anything but instances, i.e. particular or singular truths. But
> however many instances confirm a general truth, they aren’t enough to
> establish its universal necessity; for it needn’t be the case that
> what has happened always will—·let alone that it must·—happen in the
> same way. (I.Preface.2-3)

This is perhaps the strongest argument of Leibniz’s against Locke’s empiricism
and in favor of some version of Nativism. The general form of this argument
typically goes under the moniker ‘[poverty of the
stimulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_of_the_stimulus)’, and has been
used to great effect in arguments for the [innateness of our knowledge of
grammatical rules](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language)
necessary for speaking a language competently.

There is still an important question here regarding how the
understanding or intellect itself furnishes the subject with knowledge
of necessity, but experience (or at least sensation) seems to provide no
basis for such knowledge.
