# Leibniz --- Chronology

Here's a brief overview of Leibniz's life. For further details see his [SEP entry](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/).

-   Born in Leipzig in 1646, trained as a lawyer and defended his degree
    in law at, 20 in Altdorf in 1666.
-   Lived in Paris from 1672-6 where he received much of his training in
    mathematics and physics, and independently from Newton invented the
    differential and integral calculus
-   Appointed court councilor at Braunschweig-Lüneberg in Hanover in
    1676.
    -   Wrote some of his most important work (e.g. *Meditations*,
        *Discourse*, the *New System*, and the *Monadology*)
-   Died in Hanover on November 14, 1716
-   Some Contemporaries:
    -   Descartes (1596-1650)
    -   Malebranche (1638-1715)
    -   Thomas Reid (1710-1796)
    -   Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

# Metaphysics

All of the leading philosophers of the seventeenth century begin from the idea
    that the most basic kind of being, in terms of which all else is to be
    explained, is substance. This means that substance must be, in an
    appropriate sense, causally and explanatorily self-sufficient. We saw this is our previous discussion of [Descartes and Leibniz on material substance](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mclearc/ModernPhilosophyNotes/blob/master/LeibnizMatter.html#matter-is-not-a-substance). Sometimes this is put in terms of predication. Substances are the ultimate subjects of predication, which is to say that we predicate things of substances (e.g. 'The stone is cold', 'John is tall') and never predicate substances of anything else. Substances thus constitute the basic ‘furniture’ of reality.

## The Logical Conception of Substance

One of the central notions in Leibniz's philosophy is that the logical structure of our thought mirrors the real structure of reality. Leibniz thus thinks that there are close connections between the nature of truth and the nature of substance. For example:

-   All truth is analytic truth by virtue of containment[^1]
    -   in every true predication the concept of the predicate is
        contained in the concept of the subject
-   Substance is the ultimate subject of predication, and that which
    cannot be predicated of anything else
-   If x is a substance then there is a concept of x that contains all
    true predications concerning x[^2]
    -   finite beings grasp truths about substances via partial grasp of
        their complete concept
    -   God knows all truths about all substances via a perfect grasp of
        their complete concepts

Take, for example, the historical figure [Julius Caesar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_caesar). According to Leibniz, the statement 'Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC' is analytically true. An '*analytic truth*' is a truth whose predicate does not, in some sense, go beyond what is given in stating the subject. There are obvious 'stutter' examples of this --- 'all red squares are red' is analytically true since the predicate is so clearly part of the subject. But the same phenomena can occur covertly. For example, the statement 'Bachelors are unmarried men' is analytically true because part of what it is to be (or for the word 'Bachelor' to mean) a bachelor is to be an unmarried man. 

Leibniz thinks that *all* truth is analytic. So with our initial example statement 'Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC', Leibniz thinks that the relation between the subject ('Caesar') and the predicate ('crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC') is relevantly similar to the relation in the case of the 'bachelor' example. For any individual substance, Leibniz thinks there is a singular concept which picks it out and which 'contains' all the predicates of the substance (past, present, and future) in just the same way that 'bachelor' contains 'is an unmarried man'. 

Thus, if the world is the totality of individual substances, God possesses a concept of each individual substance, and knows everything that is, has been, or will be true of that individual. This is discussed by Leibniz mostly clearly in his [*Discourse on Metaphysics*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfs/leibniz1686d.pdf) (see §§8-16). This raises obvious issues for the freedom of rational beings such as ourselves. We'll discuss this later in greater depth. 

## Five Conditions on Substance

In the opening sections of the *Monadology* Leibniz articulates several conditions on his positive conception of substance. Many of these have been more or less explicit in his [critique](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mclearc/ModernPhilosophyNotes/blob/master/LeibnizMatter.html) of the Cartesian notion of material substance.

1.  **Independence**: A substance is that in which other things exist,
    which itself does not exist in anything else. (Here ‘in’ must mean
    something stronger than ‘depends upon,’ since created substance
    depends upon God for its existence.)
2.  **Persistence**: A substance is that which persists as the same
    thing through change (i.e. it possesses an identity through change).
3.  **Activity**: A substance is necessarily active, or involves a
    principle of change. Leibniz often refers to this principle as a
    substance’s “entelechy” or “primitive active force.”
4.  **Unity**: A substance is that which is truly one. A substance
    cannot be broken down into any collection of simpler beings,
    themselves satisfying the **Independence** condition. (This is
    consistent with our being able to distinguish different aspects of a
    substance, e.g. its active and passive force, or form and matter, so
    long as these cannot exist independently of the complete substance.) Substances can only come into being via an act of creation (by God) and end by annihilation (again by God).
5.  **Individuation**: A substance has a principle of individuation
    intrinsic to its nature. Thus no two substances can resemble each other completely while yet being distinct. This condition entails that substances
    satisfy the principle of the identity of indiscernibles (PII): for
    any two things, a and b, if a and b are non-identical, there is some
    property F, such that Fa and not-Fb. If a and b are Leibnizian
    substances, they satisfy PII by virtue of a property intrinsic to
    their natures.

Conditions (1)-(5) must be satisfied by anything that is to count as a
substance for Leibniz, but by themselves they do not comprise a fully
worked-out theory of substance. Leibniz experiments with at least two such
theories: (i) the corporeal substance theory; (ii) the monad theory.
These theories serve different purposes, and are not necessarily
competitors.

The corporeal substance theory and monad theory are most
plausibly seen as rival accounts of what to include in the category of ‘substance,’ i.e.,
the set of actual things that satisfy the necessary conditions for being
a substance:

(i) According to the corporeal substance theory, associated primarily
    with the middle (1680-1695) period of Leibniz’s career, substances
    are much like Aristotle’s “hylomorphic” substances: living bodies,
    which are composites of form and extended matter.

(ii) According to the monadic theory, associated with late writings such
    as the *Monadology*, the only substances are simple, soul-like
    entitites, endowed with intrinsic properties of perception and
    appetition.

There is a great deal of dispute as to whether Leibniz ever endorsed (i). It seems clear that he endorses (ii) in the *Monadology*, but whether this was his 'mature' or considered view, or just a view he articulated before his death, is not entirely clear. In his 'middle' period, in which the *Discourse* is written, Leibniz sometimes seems to think that something is a substance just in case it *has* a substantial form or soul. By the 'late' period of the *Monadology*, in contrast, Leibniz seems to think that *only* such souls or substantial forms (i.e. the 'monads') are substances. 

## Monads

Leibniz articulates the fundamental characteristics of monads as follows (M §1-15):

A.  Monads are *simple*—i.e. without parts.
B.  Monads are *immaterial*—they lack extension, shape, etc. (This is
    required by their being simple).
C.  Monads are *indestructible*—there is no natural way for a monad to
    come into or go out of existence,they must be created or destroyed
    by an act of God. Indestructibility is also a result of simplicity.
D.  Monads are *windowless*—there is no interaction, causal or
    otherwise, between monads.
    i.  No parts which may be rearranged, so no causation.
    ii. No ‘influx’ of properties, since ‘wandering’ properties are
        incoherent.
E.  Monads *differ* from one another in virtue of their *perceptions* -
    each monad has a unique point of view on the universe
F.  The order in which a monad’s perceptions proceed is in accordance
    with its *appetite*. - “Appetite” here is not to be understood in
    terms of hunger but rather in terms of a striving or motive force.

## Idealism about Matter

If immaterial monads are the fundamental substances which constitute reality, then what of the material world that we perceive? Leibniz's 'idealist' view has the following structure:

-   Physical bodies ‘result’ from monads[^3]
    -   monads ‘express’ bodies via ‘perception’[^4]
        -   physical bodies (i.e. matter) are a kind of stable group
            hallucination which Leibniz terms a ‘well-founded
            phenomenon’[^5]

To say that a physical body 'results' from a monad (or the perceptions of many monads) is not to say that it is 'built' out of monads in the way that a brick house is built from bricks. Monads are not *parts* of bodies in the way that bricks are part of a house. Instead, the existence of matter involves nothing over and above the existence of particular perceptions in a monad or monads. Because the existence of matter depends on the existence of minds and their states, matter is said to be only 'ideal', in the sense that its reality is derivative from that of mind.

[^1]: in every true affirmative proposition, whether necessary or
    contingent, universal or particular, the notion of the predicate is
    in some way included in that of the subject. *Praedicatum in est
    subjecto*; otherwise I do not know what truth is. (G II 56; L 337)

[^2]: it is the nature of an individual substance or complete being to
    have a concept so complete that it is sufficient to make us
    understand and deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to
    which the concept is attributed. An accident, on the other hand, is
    a being whose concept does not include everything that can be
    attributed to the subject to which the concept is attributed (DM §8;
    L 307)

[^3]: Accurately speaking, however, matter is not composed of these
    constitutive unities but results from them, since matter or extended
    mass is nothing but a phenomenon grounded in things, like the
    rainbow or the mock-sun, and all reality belongs only to unities.
    Phenomena can therefore always be divided into lesser phenomena
    which could be observed by other, more subtle, animals and we can
    never arrive at smallest phenomena. Substantial unities are not
    parts but foundations of phenomena. (Letter to de Volder, L 536)

[^4]: although each created monad represents the whole universe, it
    represents more distinctly the body which is particularly affected
    by it and of which it is the entelechy. And as this body expresses
    the whole universe by the connection between all matter in the
    plenum, the soul also represents the whole universe in representing
    the body which belongs to it in a particular way. (Monadology §62)

[^5]: Matter and motion are not so much substances or things as the
    phenomena of perceivers, whose reality is located in the harmony of
    perceivers with themselves (at different times) and with the other
    perceivers. (G II,270; L 537)

[^6]: Sensory awareness comes about by means of nerves, which stretch
    like threads from the brain to all the limbs, and are joined
    together in such a way that hardly any part of the human body can be
    touched without producing movement in several of the nerve-ends that
    are scattered around in that area. This movement is then transmitted
    to the other ends of the nerves which are all grouped together in
    the brain around the seat of the soul…And the various different
    states of mind, or thoughts, which are the immediate result of these
    movements are called sensory perceptions, or in ordinary speech,
    sensations.

[^7]: what is distinctive about thought is that it makes itself known to
    the mind that has it (@simmons2001, 35)

[^8]: The word “idea” is one of those that are so clear that they cannot
    be explained by others, because none is more clear and simple.
    (@arnauld1996, 25)

[^9]: One thing represents or expresses another “when there is a
    constant and fixed relation between what can be said of one and what
    can be said of another” (letter to Arnauld, G 2:112/L 339; see also
    NE 2.8.13, A/RB 131). In other words, representation involves an
    isomorphism between *res repraesentans* and *res repraesentata*.
    Resemblance is the paradigm case, but other forms of isomorphism
    will do planar projective drawings represent solids, maps represent
    cities, musical notation represents a musical composition and so on.
    (@simmons2001, 41-2)

[^10]: the crux of the matter seems to be that perceptual representation
    occurs in a simple substance. Corporeal representation, by contrast,
    occurs in composite entities: paintings, mirrors, and sense organs.
    The important consequence of a substance’s simplicity is that it
    must represent complex things from a single point of view…I think
    Leibniz means the point of view talk quite literally: a simple
    substance represents the world as if it were positioned at a single
    point in it: “mathematical points are the points of view from which
    [simple substances] express the universe” (“A New System of Nature,”
    G 4:483/AG 142). (@simmons2001, 41)

[^11]: when I consider only distinct ideas, it seems to me conceivable
    that divisible phenomena or a plurality of beings can be expressed
    or represented in a single indivisible being; and this is sufficient
    for the concept of a perception, without the necessity of adding
    thought or reflection to this representation (1687 G II 121; L 344)

[^12]: it is usually said that the *concepts* of these qualities are
    *clear*, since they serve us in recognizing them, but that these
    same concepts are not *distinct*, because we cannot distinguish or
    develop the content included in them (Leibniz 1702; L 548)

[^13]: it is good to make a distinction between ‘perception’, which is
    the internal state of the monad representing external things, and
    ‘apperception’, which is ‘consciousness’ [conscience], or the
    reflective cognition of this internal state, which is not given to
    all souls, or at all times to the same soul. (PNG §4)

[^14]: A perception of light or color of which we are aware is made up
    of many petites perceptions of which we are unaware. (NE 2.9.4, RB
    134)

    And:

    [petites perceptions] constitute that *je ne sais quoi*, those
    flavors, those images of sensible qualities, vivid in the aggregate
    but confused as to the parts. (NE Preface, RB 54-55)

[^15]: I believe one could say that sensible ideas [=sensations] are
    simple in appearance because, being confused, they do not provide
    the mind with any way to distinguish what they contain. It is like
    distant things that appear rounded because one cannot discern their
    angles, even though one is receiving some confused impression from
    them. (NE 2.2.1, RB 120; see also NE 2.20.6, RB 165 and 3.4.16, RB
    299)
