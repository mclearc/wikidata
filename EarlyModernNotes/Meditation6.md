Here I focus primarily on the 'Real Distinction' argument and the argument for the existence of an external world. 

# The 'Real Distinction' Argument #

Here Descartes famously distinguishes the mind from the body and argues that not only are we aware of ourselves fundamentally as thinking things, but that thinking things (mental substance) are in principle independent of any material body. 

The argument appears as the first step in a larger argument aimed at proving the existence of material bodies even in the face of the kinds of doubt raised in previous *Meditations*. 

## Real Distinction ##

Descartes distinguishes between three kinds of distinction, *real*, *modal*, and *conceptual* (*Principles*, §§60-2; 8A:28-31). Let's take these in reverse order. 

### Conceptual Distinctness ###

Descartes defines a *conceptual distinction* as,

>a distinction between a substance and some attribute of that
substance without which the substance is unintelligible;
alternatively, it is a distinction between two such attributes of a
single substance. Such a distinction is recognized by our inability to form a clear and distinct idea of the substance if we exclude from it the attribute in question, or, alternatively, by our inability to perceive clearly the idea of one of the two attributes if we separate it from the other. (8A:30)

This distinction depends on facts about what is *intelligible* or otherwise required for the understanding to form a clear and vivid idea of something. But it is not yet a claim about *what kind of things exist* or real metaphysical connections between conceptually distinguishable things. Hence, though there is a conceptual distinction between a substance and its attributes, the fact of such a distinction does not show that we have two metaphysically distinct entities---viz., a substance, on the one hand, and its attributes, on the other. 

### Modal Distinctness ###

Descartes explains that a *modal distinction*,

>can be taken in two ways: firstly, as a distinction between a mode, properly so called, and the substance of which it is a mode; and secondly, as a distinction between two modes of the same substance. The first kind of modal distinction can be recognized from the fact that we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance...The second kind of modal distinction is recognized from the fact that we are able to arrive at knowledge of one mode apart from another, and vice versa, whereas we cannot know either mode apart from the substance in which they both inhere. For example, if a stone is in motion and is square-shaped, I can understand the square shape without the motion and, conversely, the motion without the square shape; but I can understand neither the motion nor the shape apart from the substance of the stone. (8A:29-30)

The notion of a modal distinction is thus closely related to that of a conceptual distinction. Descartes had in fact lumped the two together in his replies to the *First set of Objections* to the *Meditations*, concerning the wax argument. Here we have the claim that we can (i) distinguish (or make intelligible) a mode of a substance from substance itself; and (ii) one mode from another. Once again though, we cannot draw any conclusion from the existence of a modal distinction to any conclusion concerning reality. Hence, from the fact that I may modally distinguish shape from motion, I cannot conclude that one can really exist without the other. 

### Real Distinctness ###

Descartes defines a real distinction as follows. 

>Strictly speaking, a real distinction exists only between two or more substances; and we can perceive that two substances are really distinct simply from the fact that
we can clearly and distinctly understand one apart from the other.

Here Descartes claims that, in the case of real distinctness, we can conclude something about how things are in reality on the basis of our pure and distinct ideas. In other words, insofar as one can vividly and clearly distinguish two substances from one another (either numerically or qualitatively), those things *really are distinct* from one another.

## The Argument ##

>[A] I know that if I have a vivid and clear thought of something, God could have created it in a way that exactly corresponds to my thought. So the fact that I can vividly and clearly think of one thing apart from another assures me that the two things are distinct from one another—·that is, that they are two·—since they can be separated by God. Never mind how they could be separated; that does not affect the judgment that they are distinct. ·So my mind is a distinct thing from my body. [B] Furthermore, my mind is me, for the following reason·. I know that I exist and that nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a thinking thing; from this it follows that my essence consists solely in my being a thinking thing, even though there may be a body that is very closely joined to me. [C] I have a vivid and clear idea of •myself as something that thinks and isn’t extended, and one of •body as something that is extended and does not think. So it is certain that •I am really distinct from •my body and can exist without it. (EMT M.29)

We should read this text as trying to prove three distinct claims (see @hatfield2003, 250).

1. *Complete Being~T~*: a thinking thing can exist as a substance whose sole essence is thought. 
2. *Complete Being~B~*: body can exist as a substance whose sole essence is extension. 
3. *Mutual Exclusion*: mental substance has no bodily modes, and bodily substance has no mental modes.

Why all three? One might think that all that is necessary for distinctness is showing (1) and (2). However, proving the first two claims leaves open the possibility that there may be some mental beings which could not exist or operate without a body and vice versa. Descartes wishes to exclude this as a possibility, if for no other reason than it was a view broadly held by his Aristotelian opponents, so showing (3) is required as well as (1) and (2).

We can raise several basic questions about the argument. For example, what role does God's power to separate mind from body play in A? Is B the argument or do we only get the full argument in C? Or is C really just an elaboration of B?

### God's Power ###

>[A] I know that if I have a vivid and clear thought of something, God could have created it in a way that exactly corresponds to my thought. So the fact that I can vividly and clearly think of one thing apart from another assures me that the two things are distinct from one another—·that is, that they are two·—since they can be separated by God. Never mind how they could be separated; that does not affect the judgment that they are distinct. ·So my mind is a distinct thing from my body.

Here is what part A [seems to be arguing](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#ReaDis):

1. I clearly and distinctly understand mind apart from body and body apart from mind.
2. God can bring about whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive.
3. God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind.
4. If God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind, then mind and body can exist apart.
5. $\therefore$ Mind and body can exist apart.

Would this be a convincing argument? Perhaps the most important worry in the argument, given the context in which Descartes was 
arguing, comes from the appeal to God. Even assuming such a being 
exists, the worry is that God could (let's assume) *miraculously* 
bring it about that a mind (or mental substance) exists apart from 
any body. But since an all-powerful God can do anything, this 
conclusion comes as no surprise. What Descartes wants is a stronger 
conclusion---viz., that it is in the *nature* of mental and material 
substance to be able to exist apart from one another. In other 
words, mind and body an exist apart not just given a miraculous act 
of God, but rather by their very natures. 

To the extent, then, that the argument relies on appeal to God, it does so only to remind the reader that God stands behind our vivid and clear ideas, validating their connection to reality. 

So what does passage A do? It tells us two important things (cf. @hatfield2003, 252). First, that clear and vivid ideas are a guide to what is really metaphysically possible (this will be severely disputed by Locke and Kant, among others). Second, it gives us a specific basis or *criterion* for real distinctness---viz., the conceivability of a thing's independent existence (cf. the discussion in the *Principles* above).

### Knowing One's Essence  ###

>[B] Furthermore, my mind is me, for the following reason·. I know that I exist and that nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a thinking thing; from this it follows that my essence consists solely in my being a thinking thing, even though there may be a body that is very closely joined to me.

B reports two findings. First, that one exists. Second, that nothing
else belongs to one (as *Meditator*) than thinking---thinking
constitutes one's *essence*. Does it follow from one's existence as a
thinking thing that one is *solely* a thinking thing and not having
either bodily features or being itself a process of some corporal
body? Not without further assumptions. However, Descartes does hold
that the essence of a substance is articulated by its 'principle
attribute' and that all modes of a substance depend upon and must be
conceived in terms of this principle attribute. Hence, if the essence
of oneself is thought, then one's principle attribute is thought (or
thinking), and thus, all modes of oneself would have to be (strictly
speaking) conceivable solely in terms of modifications of thought.

This connection between attribute and modes, along with the assumption that clear and vivid ideas are an accurate guide to 
reality (or real possibility) would yield the conclusion that a 
purely mental substance could exist independently of any physical/corporeal characteristics. But perhaps Descartes either felt the 
need to make the argument independently of any assumption regarding 
the connection between mode and essence, or he wanted to make 
explicit the point regarding our vivid and clear idea of real 
distinctness; in any case he goes on to do just this.

### The Real Distinctness of Mind and Body ###

>[C] I have a vivid and clear idea of •myself as something that thinks and isn’t extended, and one of •body as something that is extended and does not think. So it is certain that •I am really distinct from •my body and can exist without it. 

According to the Meditator's vivid and clear ideas:

i.   The self is a thinking and non-extended thing
ii.  Corporeal substance is extended and non-thinking

This gives us *Mutual Exclusion* --- claim (3) above. But we need the "Complete Being" theses to be shown as well---viz., that a thinking thing can exist as a substance whose sole essence is thought and a body can exist as a substance whose sole essence is extension. But passage B provided the claim that each of us knows ourself as a being whose sole essence is thought. So we get *Complete Being~T~*. Perhaps Descartes thought it was permissible to simply assume *Complete Being~B~*. If so then we get all three of our needed claims for meeting Descartes's goal of showing that the mind is really distinct from the body. 

Hatfield sums up the argument this way:

>Putting the three passages together, A provides the criterion for a 
real distinction between substances (capability of existing apart); 
it also offers clear and distinct perception as the method for 
determining whether the criterion is met. B affirms that a thinking 
thing can exist on its own. C affirms that this thinking thing has 
no properties peculiar to bodies. But if it can exist as a thing 
that has no bodily properties, it can exist apart from bodies. 
Which, by the criterion in A, means that mind is a substance really 
distinct from body. (@hatfield2003, 254-5)

### An Objection: Excluding Ignorance ###

We asked, above, how it was that the Meditator could know that 
thought is not identical with features or process of a material body.
Versions of this objection were pressed forcefully by Caterus (in the
*First Set of Objections*) and by Arnauld (in the *Fourth Set*). How
do we know that the apparent distinctness of mind and body is not
due to our ignorance of their real identity? Arnauld puts the issue
in terms of someone ignorant of the Pythagorean theorem trying to
reason about the essential features of triangles.

>Suppose someone knows for certain that the angle in a semi-circle is
a right angle, and thus that this angle and the diameter of the 
circle form a right-angled triangle. In spite of knowing this, he may
•doubt, or •not yet have grasped for certain, that the square on the
hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides;
indeed he may even •deny this if he has been misled by some fallacy.
(·For brevity’s sake, I’ll express this as ‘the triangle’s having the
property P’·.) But now, if he argues in the same way that Descartes
does, he may appear to have confirmation of his false belief, as
follows: ‘I vividly and clearly perceive that the triangle is right-
angled; but I doubt that it has the property P; therefore it doesn’t
belong to the essence of the triangle that it has the property P.’
(7:198-204; EMT O&R.56-7)

In other words, one might have a clear and vivid idea of a triangle
without understanding the Pythagorean theorem, but this doesn't mean
that the properties specified by the theorem, specifically that the
square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal
to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, are not in fact
essential properties of the triangle. Descartes thus needs to explain
why his Real Distinction argument doesn't generate the same problem.

Descartes's answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, refers to what the
Meditator has learned so far in the course of her meditations.
Specifically, he appeals to (i) the fact that the Meditator has clear
and vivid ideas of mind and body, where each excludes the features of
other; (ii) the nature of clear and vivid ideas is such that they
adequately represent how reality is (or what is really possible). So
Descartes simply denies Arnauld's premise, that the subject has a
clear and vivid idea of a right triangle. If they really did have 
such an idea, Descartes argues, they would know that the Pythagorean
theorem is true of such triangles.

Hence, to reject Descartes's argument we must reject either (i) the
claim that we (or the Meditator) have clear and vivid ideas of the
mind as distinct from the body, or (ii) that clear and vivid
perception is a reliable guide to real possibility/actuality. 

# Proof of the External World #

After concluding that the Meditator is distinct from her body,
Descartes goes on to argue that neither imagination nor sensation are
essential to the self, conceived purely as a thinking thing (EMT M.29). But this then raises the question of how and why the Meditating subject comes to have such sensory perceptions. 

>I have a passive faculty of sensory perception, that is, an ability to receive and recognize ideas of perceptible objects; but I would have no use for this unless something—myself or something else—had an active faculty for producing those ideas in the first place. But this faculty can’t be in me, since clearly it does not presuppose any thought on my part, and sensory ideas are produced without my cooperation and often even against my will. So sensory ideas must be produced by some substance other than me—a substance that actually has (either in a straightforward way or in a higher form) all the reality that is represented in the ideas that it produces. (M.30)

Assuming that the sensory faculty is passive (this was a common
Aristotelian assumption), Descartes argues that we need some
explanation of origin of our sensory ides. It cannot come from the
subject herself because the ideas arise involuntarily (this
assumption might be questioned since, for example, the content of our
dreams is not voluntary but comes from 'within' us). So there must be
some external cause of our sensory ideas, which itself respects the
causal principle (as discussed in *Meditation 3*).

There are three possible sources for our ideas of material things.
Either they come from bodies themselves, they come from a 'higher'
non-material being (like an angel/demon), or they come from God. 

>sensory ideas must be produced by some substance other than me—a substance that actually has (either in a straightforward way or in a higher form) all the reality that is represented in the ideas that it produces. Either (a) this substance is a body, in which case it will •straightforwardly contain everything that is represented in the ideas; or else (b) it is God, or some creature more noble than a body, in which case it will contain •in a higher form whatever is to be found in the ideas. 

Descartes then gives his argument for rejecting (b):

>I can ·reject (b), and· be confident that God does not transmit sensory ideas to me either directly from himself or through some creature that does not straightforwardly contain what is represented in the ideas. God has given me no way of recognizing any such ‘higher form’ source for these ideas; on the contrary, he has strongly inclined me to believe that bodies produce them. So if the ideas were transmitted from a source other than corporeal things, God would be a deceiver; and he is not. So bodies exist. 

Descartes's argument here seems to be that since we are naturally
strongly inclined to assent to beliefs that the causes of our sensory
ideas are the material bodies which those ideas purport to reveal, 
any other causal origin of such ideas would amount to a deceitful 
act on the part of God. One might object here, as Gassendi does (EMT
O&R.109-10), that it isn't at all clear why we should assume that 
when a body acts as a cause on the mind, that our ideas should 
reveal it accurately --- "an efficient cause is something external 
to the effect and often of a quite different nature” (7:288; O&
R.109). We thus need some reason to think that sensory ideas really do tell us truths about our environment, if we are supposed to find it plausible that any causal origin other than that of material bodies would be deceitful. In response to this kind of worry Descartes says,

>They [our sensory ideas] may not all correspond exactly with my sensory intake of them, for much of what comes in through the senses is obscure and confused. But at least bodies have all the properties that I vividly and clearly understand, that is, all that fall within the province of pure mathematics.

So our sensory ideas may not all correspond, resemble, or otherwise
reveal how things truly are in our environment (e.g. their colors, tastes, and sounds) but they do at least reveal to us the specific determinations of 
objects that reflect their geometrical (and intellectually known) essences. The argument thus looks something like this:

1. We have sensory ideas, which purport to be of external material things
2. The function of our sensory faculty is to reveal information about our environment 
3. Our sensory faculty is passive, so our sensory ideas must come from somewhere external to us
4. Sensory ideas come from either (a) bodies or (b) 'higher' non-material beings (angels, God) [causal principle] 
5. If our sensory ideas of bodies were not caused by bodies then God would be a deceiver [from 1, 2, 4]
6. God is no deceiver
7. $\therefore$ There exist material bodies that are the causes of our ideas

We thus need premise (2) in order to secure the claim that God would be deceitful if our sensory ideas were not caused by bodies. Otherwise one could object that it might not be deceitful of God to furnish our minds with sensory ideas, so long as they are not the kind of thing which is supposed to tell us about the external world.

## The Role of Senses vs. The Intellect ##

Perception of clear and vivid ideas via the Intellect (or
Understanding) provides us with knowledge of the essences of things
--- extension and its modes in the case of bodies, thought and its
modes in the case of thinking beings. The senses have an altogether
different role. They do reveal some of the actual properties of
bodies, such as size and shape, but Descartes argues that their main
function is not to reveal truths about the natures of objects in our
environments, but rather to serve us practically to inform us of
objects to seek or avoid in the promotion of our bodily well-being.

>My ‘nature’, then, in this limited sense, does indeed teach me to
avoid what hurts and to seek out what gives pleasure, and so on. But
it doesn’t appear to teach us to rush to conclusions about things
located outside us without pausing to think about the question; for
knowledge of the truth about such things seems to belong to the mind
alone, not to the combination of mind and body. So, although a star
has no more effect on my eye than a candle’s flame, my thinking of
the star as no bigger than the flame does not come from any positive
·‘natural’· inclination to believe this; it’s just a habit of thought
that I have had ever since childhood, with no rational basis for
it...(EMT M.31)

So sensory ideas (i) inform us about our environment, which is
necessary for the success of Descartes's proof of the external world;
(ii) are primarily for distinguishing bodily goods from bads, not for telling us really are. We then need to be careful about making judgments based on our sensory reports of our environment. 

>I now realize that in these cases and many others I have been in
the habit of misusing the order of nature. The right way to use the
sensory perceptions that nature gives me is as a guide to what is
beneficial or harmful for my mind-body complex; and they are vivid 
and clear enough for that. But it is a misuse of them to treat them 
as reliable guides to the essential nature of the bodies located 
outside me, for on that topic they give only very obscure and 
confused information. (EMT M.31)
