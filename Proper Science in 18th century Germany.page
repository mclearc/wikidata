# Proper Science

The epistemic ideal pursued in the 16^th^ and 17^th^ centuries was that of a demonstrative science along the lines first articulated in Aristotle's *Posterior Analytics*. This is clear in the work of Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Locke. But what about in Germany?

## Leibniz


## Christian Wolff (1679-1754)

[Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) aimed to articulate a complete [demonstrative science of human knowledge](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/#HumSci). Wolff believed that all of human knowledge could be presented as demonstrably certain, in just the way that mathematics is, and could thus be rationally ordered into a systematics and unified whole. Here are a few relevant quotes:

>By science, I understand, that habit of the understanding, whereby, in a manner not to be refuted, we establish our assertions on irrefragable grounds or principles (§2, Chapter 1 of the German Logic).

>By science here I mean the habit of demonstrating propositions, i.e., the habit of inferring conclusions by legitimate sequence from certain and immutable principles (§30 of the Preliminary Discourse).

>Science is the capacity to prove from indisputable grounds everything one asserts or, in a word, the capacity to demonstrate; and in demonstration truths are connected together; therefore through science one knows the connection of truths, and thus science comes from reason (§383 of the German Metaphysics).

The order of the sciences also reflects the hierarchy of conceptual knowledge. In §§94-95 of the Preliminary Discourse, Wolff writes: 

>If everything is to be demonstrated accurately in physics, then principles must be borrowed from metaphysics. Physics explains those things which are possible through bodies (§59). If these things are to be treated demonstratively, then the notions of body, matter, nature, motion, the elements, and other such general notions must be known. For such notions contain the reason of many things. Now these notions are explained in general cosmology and in ontology (§§73,78). Therefore, if all things are to be demonstrated accurately in physics, principles must be borrowed from general cosmology and ontology... .Thus it is clear that metaphysics must precede physics...
