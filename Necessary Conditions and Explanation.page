It is important that we distinguish between the necessary conditions for
X and the explanation of/for X. 

# Existence vs. Possibility #

We can distinguish between the conditions necessary for the existence of
something and the conditions necessary for its possibility. The latter
may or may not be sufficient for its existence. 

[kreines2009]() argues that 

>Kant’s view rather rests on the intuition that an explanation must provide
information about an underlying condition on which an explanandum depends. To
state a particular law of nature, then, is not just to summarize or describe a
regularity in nature; it is to identify a kind on whose nature some regularity
depends, in the sense that it is necessitated by the nature of that kind. I
call this Kant’s ‘necessitation account’, and I call these laws
‘necessitation-laws’ (@kreines2009, 528)

This alludes to what Kreines calls the 'simple intuition' --- viz. the idea
that 'an explanation must provide information about an underlying condition on
which an explanandum really depends' (@kreines2009, 531). Clearly Kreines
thinks there is an important connection between necessary conditions and
explanation. Kreines seems to think that the assymmetry of dependence relations
tracks explanatory relations. So the fact that the barometer level depends on
atmospheric pressure means that its level is *explained by* atmospheric
pressure.

But clearly *any* necessatation won't do, at least for the Aristotelian
tradition. Aristotle denies that mere logical realtions are sufficient
for explanation, since we can present logical syllogisms in a manner
which obscures the *explanans*. His example in the *Posterior Analytics*
concerns the twinkling of the stars (I.13, 78a23-b3).

1. The planets do not twinkle 
2. What does not twinkle is near 
3. $\therefore$ The planets are near

vs. 

1. The planets are near
2. What is near does not twinkle 
3. $\therefore$ The planets do not twinkle

Though both are logically valid, only the second proof reasons from
cause to effect. So, according to Aristotle, only the second proof gives
a genuine explanation of its conclusion. 

The [appendix](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/s2.html#4) to the
[SEP entry on Analysis](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/index.html)
by Michael Beaney helps make this clear.

>On this conception, then, there could be a logic of discovery as well as a

>twinkle’), but with this assumption, there is a nice symmetry between analysis

Similarly, Kant denies that *apogogic* proof is appropriate for
generating proper scientific knowledge. He makes this clear in a number
of passages in the logic lectures.

>However popular it may be, then, one makes use of apagogical 234 proof only
>_ad interim,_ etc. Proper, true insight is actually attained only through
>direct, genetic proof. A cognition is proved _directe_ when its truth can be
>shown from the relation to the grounds. But _indirecte,_ on the other hand,
>when its truth flows from the relation to the consequences. Direct proofs are
>actually genetic and are developed _per rationes essendi, non veto
>cognoscenti_ [through grounds of being not through grounds of true
>knowledge]._ _Indirect proofs, however, are developed _per rationes
>cognoscendi, non essence._ [through grounds of knowledge not of being]. To
>infer affirmatively from the consequences to the grounds is wrong, but instead
>this must always happen negatively. (BL 24:233-4; cf. BL 24:99, 233-4; VL
>24:893; DW 24:748-9)

>The proofs on which any mediated or mediate certainty of a cognition rests are
>either _direct_ proofs or _indirect,_ i.e., _apagogical_ ones. When I prove a
>truth from its grounds I provide a direct proof for it, and when I infer the
>truth of a proposition from the falsehood of its opposite I provide an
>indirect one. If this latter is to have validity, however, the propositions
>must be opposed _contradictorily_ or _diametraliter._ For two propositions
>opposed only as contraries _(contrarie opposita)_ can both be false. A proof
>that is the ground of mathematical certainty is called a _demonstration,_ and
>that which is the ground of philosophical certainty is called an _acroamatic_
>proof. The essential parts of any proof in general are its _matter_ and its
>_form,_ or the _ground of proof_ and the _consequent._ (JL 9:71)

>From the consequence, then, we may infer to a ground, but without being able
>to determine this ground. Only from the complex of all consequences can one
>infer _to a determinate ground,_ infer that it is the true ground. The former
>mode of inference, according to which the consequence can only be a
>_negatively_ and _indirectly_ sufficient criterion of the truth of a
>cognition, is called in logic the _apagogic_ mode _(modus tollens)._ (JL 9:52)

So Kant seems to require that scientific knowledge requires not only
the existence of assymetric necessitation relations between ground an
consequent, but also that such a relation proceed from what is more
basic to what is derivative.[^15147]
