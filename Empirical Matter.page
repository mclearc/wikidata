title: The Empirical Status of `<matter>` 
categories: Kant, Definition, MFNS
...

Watkins frames the fundamental issue of understanding the Preface of the MFNS in terms of empircal status of the concept `<matter>`. I though this misguided, but now I'm not so sure. 

He rightly points out that an empirical concept is one which does not guarantee the instantiation of its object. Watkins thinks this is in tension with the status of the pure part of physics as an a priori and certain science. How can we have anything more than logical certainties if we cannot be a priori certain that the subject matter of our science is instantiated?
